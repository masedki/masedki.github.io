right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries.  this catheter was exchanged over wire.  a 5-french marker pigtail catheter was directed into the main pulmonary artery.  a second site of venous access was achieved in and the left femoral vein with the placement of 5-french sheath. using a 4-french sheath, a 4-french pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta and left ventricle.  angiogram with injection in the main pulmonary artery demonstrated stable stent configuration of the proximal branch pulmonary arteries with intimal ingrowth in the region of the proximal stents.  the distal right pulmonary measured approximately 10 mm in diameter with a mid stent section measuring 9.4 mm and the proximal stent near the origin of the right pulmonary artery of 5.80 mm.  the distal left pulmonary measured approximately 10 mm in diameter with a mid stent measuring 10.3 mm and the proximal stent near the origin of the left pulmonary artery is 6.8 mm diameter.  the left femoral venous sheath was exchanged over wire for a 7-french sheath.  guidewires were then advanced through the respective venous sheath into the branch pulmonary arteries and simultaneous balloon pulmonary arterioplasty was performed using the two z-med 12 x 4 cm balloon catheter was advanced into the branch of pulmonary arteries and inflated maximally to 9 hemispheres of pressure on 5 occasions near complete disappearance of proximal waist.  the balloon catheter was then exchanged for a 5-french mistique catheter for pressure pull-back and measurement in the angiogram.  the catheter&#8217;s wires were then removed and final hemodynamic assessment was made with the wedge catheter. flows were calculated by the fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity. cineangiograms were obtained with angiograph injection in the main pulmonary artery. after angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  there were no complications. discussion:  oxygen consumption was assumed to be in normal.  mixed venous saturation that was not normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  left side of the heart was mildly desaturated following a part to parenchymal lung disease with the partial pressure of oxygen of only 82 mmhg.  aphasic right atrial pressures were normal with an a-wave similar to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  left ventricular systolic pressure was moderately elevated at 70% of systemic level and there was no obstruction into the proximal main pulmonary artery.  there was a 20 mmhg of peak systolic gradient across the branch pulmonary artery stents to the distal artery.  right and left pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an a-wave similar to the mildly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 13 mmhg.  left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic.  no outflow constriction to the ascending aorta.  phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.  the calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal.  vascular resistances were normal.  angiogram with injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency, well functioning contegra valve with no appreciable calcification.  the proximal narrowing of the distal main pulmonary artery was appreciated.  neointimal ingrowth within the proximal stents were appreciated.  there is good distal growth of the pulmonary arteries.  arborization appeared normal.  levophase contrast returned to the heart appeared normal with a well-functioning left ventricle and the right aortic arch.  following the branch pulmonary artery angioplasty that was increased in the mixed venous saturation, as well as an increase in the systemic arterial saturation.  right ventricular systolic pressure felt slightly to 40 mmhg with an increase in systemic arterial pressure with a systolic pressure ratio of 54%.  the main pulmonary pressures remained similar.  there was 10 mmhg systolic gradient into the branch of pulmonary arteries.  there is an increase in distal branch of pulmonary arteries with the mean pressure increased from 16 mmhg to 21 mmhg.  final angiogram with injection in the main pulmonary artery showed a competent contegra valve.  a brisk flow through the proximal branch stents with the improved caliber of the branch pulmonary artery lumens.  there was no evidence of intimal disruption.

dilated cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 10%, been referred for aicd implantation because of his low ejection fraction and a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.  he has underlying sinus bradycardia.  therefore, will likely be pacing much of the time and would benefit from a biventricular pacing device. risks and benefits:  risks, benefits, and alternatives to implantation of biventricular aicd and defibrillation threshold testing were discussed with the patient.  risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, vascular injury, cardiac perforation, stroke, myocardial infarction, the need for urgent cardiovascular surgery, and death were discussed with the patient.  the patient agreed both verbally and via written consent. description of procedure:  the patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the fasting state.  the region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  lidocaine 1% (20 ml) was administered to the area.  after achieving appropriate anesthesia, a percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was performed under fluoroscopy with two separate sticks.  guidewires were advanced down into the left axillary vein.  following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  lidocaine 1% (10 ml) was administered to the medial aspect of the incision and a pocket was fashioned in the medial direction.  using the more lateral of the guidewires, a 7-french side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  the dilator was removed and another wire was advanced down into the sheath.  the sheath was then backed up over the top of the two wires.  one wire was pinned to the drape and using the alternate wire, a 9-french side-arm sheath was advanced down into the left axillary vein.  the dilator and wire were removed.  a defibrillation lead was then advanced down into the atrium.  the peel-away sheath was removed.  the lead was then passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in the apical septal location.  the active fix screw was deployed.  adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  a 10-volt pacing was used temporarily and there was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  the suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  using the wire that had been pinned to the drape, a 7-french side-arm sheath was advanced over this wire into the axillary vein.  the wire and dilator were removed.  an active pacing lead was then advanced down to the right atrium and the peel-away sheath was removed.  the lead was parked until a later time.  using the separate access point, a 9-french side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  the dilator and wire were removed.  a curved outer sheath catheter as well as an inner catheter were advanced down into the area of the coronary sinus.  the coronary sinus was cannulated.  inner catheter was removed and a balloon-tipped catheter was advanced into the coronary sinus.  a coronary sinus venogram was then performed.  it was noted that the most suitable location for lead placement was the middle cardiac vein.  this was cannulated and a passive lead was advanced over a whisper eds wire into a distal position.  adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  a 10-volt pacing was used temporarily.  there was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  the outer sheath was peeled away.  the 9 french sheath was then peeled away.  suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  at this point, the atrial lead was then positioned in the right atrial appendage using a preformed j-curved stylet.  the lead body was turned several times and the lead was affixed to the tissue.  adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  a suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  the pocket was then washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the leads.  the leads were carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator and the entire system was placed in the pocket.  the pocket was then closed with 2-0, 3-0, and 4-0 vicryl using a running mattress stitch.  sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure and no acute complications were noted. the patient was sedated further and shock on t was performed

~~~ -->     preoperative diagnoses:  progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function. postoperative diagnoses:  progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function. operative procedure:  coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) x4. grafts performed:  lima to lad, left radial artery from the aorta to the pda, left saphenous vein graft from the aorta sequential to the diagonal to the obtuse marginal. indications for procedure:  the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman, who presented with six-month history of progressively worsening exertional angina.  he had a positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved lv function.  he was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries. findings during the procedure:  the aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp.  left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits.  radial artery graft was a smaller sized conduit, otherwise good quality.  all distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present.  the smallest target was the pda, which was about 1.5 mm in size.  all the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater.  the patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  he was transferred on neo-synephrine, nitroglycerin, precedex drips.  cross clamp time was 102 minutes, bypass time was 120 minutes. details of the procedure:  the patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table.  after he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right ij triple-lumen catheter and cordis catheter, right radial a-line, foley catheter, tee probes were placed and interfaced appropriately.  the patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion.  preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest. after prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed.  left internal mammary artery was taken down.  simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques.  simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques.  subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure. heparin was given.  pericardium was opened and suspended.  during the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally.  only a limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery. pericardium was opened and suspended.  pursestring sutures were placed.  aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass.  with satisfactory flow, the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using a combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia.  an initial dose of about 1500 ml was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain a good arrest and to protect the heart. pda was exposed first.  the right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation.  even in the pda, calcification was noted in a spotty fashion.  arteriotomy on the pda was performed in a soft area and 1.5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions.  end radial to side pda anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 prolene.  next, the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed.  arteriotomy was performed.  an end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 prolene.  this graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and a diamond shaped side-to-side anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 prolene.  next, a slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and lima was accommodated in the slit on its way to the lad.  lad was exposed.  arteriotomy was performed.  an end lima to side lad anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 prolene.  lima was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle. two stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4-mm punch.  two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta, and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6-0 prolene.  the patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de-airing maneuvers were performed.  following this, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity.  temporary v-pacing wires were placed.  blake drains were placed in the left chest, the right chest, as well as in the mediastinum.  left chest blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed.  after an adequate period of rewarming during which time, temporary v-pacing wires were also placed, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  with satisfactory hemodynamics, good lv function on tee and baseline ekg, heparin was reversed using protamine.  decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation.  hemostasis was assured.  mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves, heavy vicryl for musculofascial closure, and monocryl for subcuticular skin closure.  dressings were applied.  the patient was transferred to the icu in stable condition.  he tolerated the procedure well.  all counts were correct at the termination of the procedure.  cross clamp time was 102 minutes.  bypass time was 120 minutes.  the patient was transferred on neo-synephrine, nitroglycerin, and precedex drips.     <!-- 	cv

after which, her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. then, a 6-french sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0.035 guide wire. coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6-french jl4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery. a 6-french jr4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit. subsequently, a 6-french angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform a power injection, a left ventriculogram at 8 ml per second for a total of 30 ml. at the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation, the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery, which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque. did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation. as such, an initial attempt to advance a perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery. as such, the perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system. we then replaced this with a 6-french angio-seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis. the patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the mac unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home. hemodynamic data: opening aortic pressure 125/60, left ventricular pressure 108/4 with an end-diastolic pressure of 16. there was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle. left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1+. there was normal wall motion in the rao projection. coronary angiogram: the left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque. the proximal lad was 100% occluded. the left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque. the obtuse marginal branch which operates as an om-2 had a mid approximately 80% stenosis at a kink in the artery. this appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis, the saphenous vein graft to the om. this is a very small-caliber vessel and is 1.5-mm in diameter at best. the right coronary artery is dominant. the native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque. the distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40% stenosis. the posterior left ventricular branch has a proximal 50 to 60% stenosis. the proximal pda has a 40 to 50% stenosis. the saphenous vein graft to the right pda is widely patent. there was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the pda. the runoff from the pda is nice with the native proximal pda and plv disease as noted above. there is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft. the saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent. the lad beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small-caliber vessel. there is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch. the saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004. overall, this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004. conclusion: 100% proximal lad mild left circumflex disease with an om that is a small-caliber vessel with an 80% lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention. the native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate plv and pda disease. the saphenous vein graft to the om is known to be 100% occluded. the saphenous vein graft to the pda and the saphenous vein graft to the lad are open. normal left ventricular systolic function. plan: the plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification. aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control. the patient&#8217;s goal ldl will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150, and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking. after her bedrest is complete, she will be dispositioned to home, after which, she will be following up with me in the office within 1 month. we will also plan to perform a carotid duplex doppler ultrasound to evaluate her carotid bruits.     <!-- 	cv

main pulmonary artery to glenn, mean of 12 to mean of 13; right pulmonary artery to glenn, mean of 12 to mean of 13; ascending aorta 68/35 to descending aorta 62/35. interpretation: right and left pulmonary artery pressures are appropriate for this situation. there is a gradient of, at most, 2 mmhg on pullback from both the right and left pulmonary arteries to the glenn shunt. the left atrial mean pressure is normal. right ventricular end-diastolic pressure is, at most, slightly elevated. there is a trivial gradient between the right ventricle and ascending aorta consistent with trivial neo-aortic valve stenosis. there is a roughly 10-mm gradient between the right ventricle and descending aorta, consistent with additional coarctation of the aorta. on pullback from ascending to descending aorta, there is a 6-mmhg gradient between the two. systemic blood pressure is normal. iii. oximetry: superior vena cava 65, right pulmonary artery 67, left pulmonary artery 65, left atrium 96, right atrium 87, inferior vena cava 69, aorta 86, right ventricle 83. interpretation: systemic arteriovenous oxygenation difference is normal, consistent with a normal cardiac output. left atrial saturation is fairly normal, consistent with normal oxygenation in the lungs. the saturation falls passing from the left atrium to the right atrium and further to the right ventricle, consistent with mixing of pulmonary venous return and inferior vena cava return, as would be expected in this patient. iv. special procedure (s): none done. v. calculations:please see the calculation sheet. calculations were based upon an assumed oxygen consumption. the _____ saturation used was 67%, with a pulmonary artery saturation of 65%, a left atrial saturation of 96%, and an aortic saturation of 86%. using the above information, the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio was 0.6. systemic blood flow was 5.1 liters per minute per meter squared. pulmonary blood flow was 3.2 liters per minute per meter squared. systemic resistance was 9.8 wood&#8217;s units times meter squared, which is mildly diminished. pulmonary resistance was 2.5 wood&#8217;s units times meter squared, which is in the normal range. vi. angiography: the injection to the glenn shunt demonstrates a wide-open glenn connection. the right pulmonary artery is widely patent, without stenosis. the proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery is significantly narrowed, but does open up near its branch point. the right pulmonary artery measures 6.5, the left pulmonary artery measures 3.0 mm. the aorta at the diaphragm on a later injection was 5.5 mm. there is a small collateral off the innominate vein passing to the left upper lobe. flow to both upper lobes is diminished versus lower lung fields. there is normal return of the pulmonary veins from the right, with simultaneous filling of the left atrium and right atrium. there is normal return of the left lower pulmonary vein and left upper pulmonary vein. there is some reflux of dye into the inferior vena cava from the right atrium. the right ventriculogram demonstrates a heavily pedunculated right ventricle with somewhat depressed right ventricular systolic function. the calculated ejection fraction from the lao projection is only mildly diminished at 59%. there is no significant tricuspid regurgitation. the neo-aortic valve appears to open well with no stenosis. the ascending aorta is dilated. there is mild narrowing of the aorta at the isthmal area. on some projections, there appears to be a partial duplication of the aortic arch, probably secondary to this patient&#8217;s style of norwood reconstruction. there is some filling of the right upper and left upper lobes from collateral blood flow, with the left being more opacified than the right. the inferior vena cavagram demonstrates normal return of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium. the ascending aortogram demonstrates trivial aortic insufficiency, which is probably catheter-induced. the coronary arteries are poorly seen. again, a portion of the aorta appears to be partially duplicated. there is faint opacification of the left upper lung from collateral blood flow. the above-mentioned narrowing of the aortic arch is again noted.     <!-- 	cv

~~~ -->     preoperative diagnosis:  coronary artery disease. postoperative diagnosis:  coronary artery disease plus intimal calcification in the mid abdominal aorta without significant stenosis. description of procedure:left heart catheterization with angiography and mid abdominal aortography:under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with premedication, a right groin preparation was done.  using the percutaneous seldinger technique via the right femoral artery, a left heart catheterization was performed.  coronary arteriography was performed with 6-french performed coronary catheters.  we used a 6-french jr4 and jl4 catheters to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary arteries.  after using the jr4 6-french catheter, nitroglycerin was administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm, and following that, we used a 5-french jr4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery.  a pigtail catheter was placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection was performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, as there was dense calcification in the mid abdominal aorta. analysis of pressure data:  left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mmhg.  on continuous tracing from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta, there is no gradient across the aortic valve.  the aortic pressures were normal.  contours of intracardiac pressure were normal. analysis of angiograms:  selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle, coronary arteries, and mid abdominal aorta.  a pigtail catheter was introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position.  the mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility.  the left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility.  aneurysmal dilatation and/or dyskinesia absent.  the aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility.  the ascending aorta appeared normal. pigtail catheter was introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal arteries.  an abdominal aortic injection was performed.  under fluoroscopy, we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation.  there was some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pass that area and it was felt that might be a tight stenosis.  the abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity.  there is a normal left renal artery, normal right renal artery.  the celiac seems to be normal, but what i believe is the splenic artery seen initially at its origin is normal.  the common left iliac and common right iliac arteries are essentially normal in this area. coronary anatomy:  one notes ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery.  cineangiogram obtained with 6-french jr4 and 5-french jr4 catheters.  prior to the introduction of the 5-french jr4 nitroglycerin was administered sublingually.  the 6-french jr4 catheters appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50%.  there was backwash of dye into the aorta, although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery.  in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the shepherd turn, there is a 50% smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third.  then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divides into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel.  the distal portion of the vessel is free of disease.  the conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery.  we then removed the 6-french catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5-french catheter and again finding a stenosis, may be less than 50%.  at the ostium of the right coronary artery, calcification again is identified.  backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion, looked about the same 50% along the proximal turn of the shepherd turn area. the left coronary artery is normal, although there is a rim of ostial calcification, but there is no tapering or stenosis.  it forms the left anterior descending artery, the ramus branch, and the circumflex artery. the left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel, very tortuous in its proximal segment, very tortuous in its mid and distal segment.  there appears to be some mild stenosis of 10% in the proximal segment.  it gives off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease.  the remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease.  upon injection of the left coronary artery, we see what i believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle, but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus, and we get a ventriculogram performed.  i could not identify an isolated area, but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collaterals that this is taking place. the ramus branch is normal and free of disease. the left circumflex artery is a tortuous vessel over the lateral wall and terminating in the inferoposterior wall that is free of disease. the patient has a predominantly right coronary system.  there is no _______ circulation connecting the right and left coronary systems. the patient tolerated the procedure well.  the catheter was removed.  hemostasis was achieved.  the patient was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition. impression:1.  excellent left ventricular contractility with normal left ventricular cavity size.2.  calcification of the mid abdominal aorta with wide patency of all vessels.  the left and right renal arteries are normal.  the external iliac arteries are normal.3.  essentially normal left coronary artery with some type of interventricular septal to left ventricular fistula.4.  ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery that appears to be about 50% or greater.  the proximal right coronary artery has 50% stenosis as well.5.  coronary calcification is seen under fluoroscopy at the ostia of the left and right coronary arteries. recommendations:  the patient has heavy calcification of the coronary arteries and continued risk factor management is needed.  the ostial lesion of the right coronary artery may be severe.  it is at least 50%, but it could be worse.  therefore, she will be evaluated for the possibility of an ivus and/or _______ analysis of the proximal right coronary artery.  we will reevaluate her stress nuclear study as well.  continue aggressive medical therapy.     <!-- 	cv

~~~ -->     history of present illness: the patient is known to me secondary to atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, partially due to medications, at least when i first saw him in the office on 01/11/06. he is now 77 years old. he is being seen on the seventh floor. the patient is in room 7607. the patient has a history of recent adenocarcinoma of the duodenum that was found to be inoperable, since it engulfed the porta hepatis. the workup began with gi bleeding. he was seen in my office on 01/11/06 for preop evaluation due to leg edema. a nonocclusive dvt was diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein. both legs were edematous, and bilateral venous insufficiency was also present. an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50%. the patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with a greenfield filter since anticoagulant was contraindicated. additional information on the echocardiogram, where a grossly dilated left atrium, moderately severely dilated right atrium. the rhythm was, as stated before, atrial fibrillation with slow atrioventricular conduction and an intraventricular conduction delay on the monitor strip. there was mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonic insufficiency. the ejection fraction was considered low normal, since it was estimated 50 to 54%. the patient received blood while in the hospital due to anemia. the leg edema improved while lying down, suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency was indeed present. the patient, who was diabetic, received consultation by dr. r. he was also a chronic hypertensive and was treated for that with ace inhibitors. the atrial fibrillation was slow, and no digitalis or beta blockers were recommended at the same time. as a matter of fact, they were discontinued. now, the patient denied any shortness of breath or chest pain throughout this hospitalization, and cardiac nuclear studies performed earlier demonstrated no reversible ischemia. allergies: the patient has no known drug allergies. his diabetes was suspected to be complicated with neuropathy due to tingling in both feet. he received his immunizations with flu in 2005 but did not receive pneumovax. social history: the patient is married. he had 1 child who died at the age of 26 months of unknown etiology. he quit smoking 6 years ago but dips (smokeless) tobacco. family history: mother had cancer, died at 70. father died of unknown cause, and brother died of unknown cause. functional capacity: the patient is wheelchair bound at the time of his initial hospitalization. he is currently walking in the corridor with assistance. nocturia twice to 3 times per night. review of systems:ophthalmologic: uses glasses.ent: complains of occasional sinusitis.cardiovascular: hypertension and atrial fibrillation.respiratory: normal.gi: colon bleeding. the patient believes he had ulcers.genitourinary: normal.musculoskeletal: complains of arthritis and gout.integumentary: edema of ankles and joints.neurological: tingling as per above. denies any psychiatric problems.endocrine: diabetes, niddm.hematologic and lymphatic: the patient does not use any aspirin or anticoagulants and is not of anemia. laboratory: current ekg demonstrates atrial fibrillation with incomplete left bundle branch block pattern. q waves are noticed in the inferior leads. nonprogression of the r-wave from v1 to v4 with small r-waves in v5 and v6 are suggestive of an old anterior and inferior infarcts. left ventilator hypertrophy and strain is suspected. physical examination:general: on exam, the patient is alert, oriented and cooperative. he is mildly pale. he is an elderly gentleman who is currently without diaphoresis, pallor, jaundice, plethora, or icterus.vital signs: blood pressure is 159/69 with a respiratory rate of 20, pulse is 67 and irregularly irregular. pulse oximetry is 100.neck: without jvd, bruit, or thyromegaly. the neck is supple.chest: symmetric. there is no heave or retraction.heart: the heart sounds are irregular and no significant murmurs could be auscultated.lungs: clear to auscultation.abdomen: exam was deferred.legs: without edema. pulses: dorsalis pedis pulse was palpated bilaterally. medications: current medications include enalapril, low dose enoxaparin, fentanyl patches. he is no longer on fluconazole. he is on a sliding scale as per dr. holden. he is on lansoprazole (prevacid), toradol, piperacillin/tazobactam, hydralazine p.r.n., zofran, dilaudid, benadryl, and lopressor p.r.n. assessment and plan: the patient is a very pleasant elderly gentleman with intractable/inoperable malignancy. his cardiac issues are chronic and most likely secondary to long term hypertension and diabetes. he has chronic atrial fibrillation. i do not envision a scenario whereby he will become a candidate for management of this arrhythmia beyond weight control. he is also not a candidate for anticoagulation, which is, in essence, a part and parcel of the weight control. reason being is high likelihood for gi bleeding, especially given the diagnosis of invasive malignancy with involvement of multiple organs and lymph nodes. at this point, i agree with the notion of hospice care. if his atrioventricular conduction becomes excessive, occasional nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as diltiazem or beta blockers would be appropriate; otherwise, i would keep him off those medications due to evidence of slow conduction in the presence of digitalis and beta blockers.     <!--

~~~ -->     reason for referral:  cardiac evaluation and treatment in a patient who came in the hospital with abdominal pain. history:  this is a 77-year-old white female patient whom i have known for the last about a year or so who has underlying multiple medical problems including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post aortocoronary bypass surgery about eight years ago at halifax medical center where she had triple vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and right coronary arteries.  since then, she has generally done well.  she used to be seeing another cardiologist and apparently she had a stress test in september 2008 and she was otherwise cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography, but the patient declined to have one done and since then she has been on medical therapy. the patient had been on medical therapy at home and generally doing well.  recently, she had no leg swelling, undue exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  she denies any rest or exertional chest discomfort.  yesterday evening, she had her dinner and she was sitting around and she felt discomfort in the chest at about 7:00 p.m.  the discomfort was a crampy pain in the left lower quadrant area, which seemed to radiating to the center of the abdomen and to the right side and it was off and on lasting for a few minutes at a time and then subsiding.  later on she was nauseous, but she did not have any vomiting.  she denied any diarrhea.  no history of fever or chills.  since the pain seemed to persist, the patient came to the hospital emergency room at 11:35 p.m. where she was seen and admitted for the same.  she was given morphine, zofran, demerol, another zofran, and reglan as well as demerol again and she was given intravenous fluids.  subsequently, her pain finally went away and she does not have any pain since about 7:00 a.m. this morning.  the patient was admitted however for further workup and treatment.  at the time of my examination this afternoon, the patient is sitting, lying in bed and comfortable and has no abdominal pain of any kind.  she has not been fed any food, however.  the patient also had had pelvis and abdominal ct scan performed, which has been described to be partial small bowel obstruction, internal hernia, volvulus or adhesion most likely in the left flank area.  the patient has had left nephrectomy and splenectomy, which has been described.  a 1.5-mm solid mass is described to be in the lower pole of the kidney.  the patient also has been described to have diverticulosis without diverticulitis on this finding. currently however, the patient has no clinical symptoms according to her. past medical history:  she has had hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the last 15 years, diabetes mellitus for the last eight years, and coronary artery disease for last about eight years or so.  she had a chest and back pain about eight years ago for about two weeks and then subsequently she was reported to be evaluated.  she has a small myocardial infarction and then she was under the care of dr. a and she had aortocoronary bypass surgery at halifax medical center by dr. b, which was a three-vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and distal right coronary artery respectively. she had had nuclear stress test with dr. c on september 3, 2008, which was described to be abnormal with ischemic defects, but i do not think the patient had any further cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography after that.  she has been treated medically. this patient also had an admission to this hospital in may 2008 also for partial small bowel obstruction and cholelithiasis and sigmoid diverticulosis.  she was described to have had a hemorrhagic cyst of the right kidney.  she has mild arthritis for the last 10 or 15 years.  she has a history of gerd for the last 20 years, and she also has a history of peptic ulcer disease in the duodenum, but never had any bleeding.  she has a history of diverticulosis as mentioned.  no history of tia or cva.  she has one kidney.  she was in a car accident in 1978 and afterwards she had to have left nephrectomy as well as splenectomy because of rupture.  the patient has a history of pulmonary embolism once about eight years ago after her aortocoronary bypass surgery.  she describes this to be a clot on left lung.  i am not sure if she had any long-term treatment, however. in the past, the patient had aortocoronary bypass surgery in 2003 and incisional hernia surgery in 1979 as well as hysterectomy in 1979 and she had splenectomy and nephrectomy as described in 1978. family history:  her father died at age of 65 of massive heart attack and mother died at age of 62 of cancer.  she had a one brother who died of massive heart attack in his 50s, a brother died at the age of 47 of cancer, and another brother died in his 60s of possible rupture of appendix. social history:  the patient is a widow.  she lives alone.  she does have three daughters, two of them live in georgia and one lives in tennessee.  she did smoke in the past up to one to one and a half packs of cigarettes per day for about 10 years, but she quit long time ago.  she never drank any alcohol.  she likes to drink one or two cups of tea in a day. allergies:  paxil. medications:  her home medications prior to coming in include some of the following medications, although the exact list is not available in the chart at this stage, but they have been on glyburide, januvia, lisinopril, metformin, metoprolol, simvastatin, ranitidine, meloxicam, and furosemide. review of systems:  appetite is good.  she sleeps good at night.  she has no headaches and she has mild joint pains from arthritis.

apex, peaking in lv systole, no diastolic murmur heard.abdomen:  soft, obese, no tenderness, no masses felt.  bowel sounds are present.extremities:  bilateral trace edema.  the extremities are heavy.  there is no pitting at this stage.  no clubbing or cyanosis.  distal pulses are fair.central nervous system:  without any obvious focal deficits. laboratory data:  includes an electrocardiogram, which shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and right bundle branch block.  this is overall unchanged compared to previous electrocardiogram, which also has the same present.  nuclear stress test from 2008 was described to show ejection fraction of 49% and inferior and posterolateral ischemia.  otherwise, laboratory data includes on this patient at this stage wbc 18.3, hemoglobin 15.5, hematocrit is 47.1, and platelet count is 326,000.  electrolytes, sodium 137, potassium 5.2, chloride 101, co2 27, bun 34, creatinine 1.2, calcium 9.5, and magnesium 1.7.  ast and alt are normal.  albumin is 4.1.  lipase and amylase are normal.  inr is 0.92.  urinalysis is relatively unremarkable except for trace protein.  chest x-ray has been described to show elevated left hemidiaphragm and median sternotomy sutures.  no infiltrates seen.  abdomen and pelvis cat scan findings are as described before with suggestion of partial small bowel obstruction and internal hernia.  volvulus or adhesions have been considered.  left nephrectomy and splenectomy demonstrated right kidney has a 1.5 cm solid mass at the lower pole suspicious for neoplasm according to the radiologist&#8217;s description and there is diverticulosis. impression:1.  coronary artery disease and prior aortocoronary bypass surgery, currently clinically the patient without any angina.2.  possible small old

infection (uti) with no blood, positive nitrates, positive leuk esterase, 5 to 10 white blood cells, and many bacteria with no epithelial cells. impression:  elderly white female status post traumatic left hip fracture with atypical chest pain and baseline st-segment abnormalities nondiagnostic. recommendations:1.  cardiac clearance:  the patient with cardiac risk factors including age and family.  not smoking, hypertensive, dyslipidemic.  does have a sedentary lifestyle, but it is not morbidly obese.  given the atypical nature of her chest pain and the nondiagnostic ekg changes, i feel it is safe to proceed with orthopedic procedure without further cardiac evaluation.  we would, however, treat with preoperative beta-blockers.2.  we will follow the patient perioperatively with electrocardiogram and troponin.3.  we would recommend treatment for presumed urinary tract infection. followup:  the patient will be followed in-house by members of cardiology associates and recommendations made as clinically appropriate.     <!-- 	cv

~~~ -->     history of present illness:  mr. a is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently who has had atrial flutter, who estimates he has had six cardioversions since 10/09, and estimates that he has had 12 to 24 in his life beginning in 2006 when the atrial fibrillation first emerged.  he, since 10:17 p.m. on 01/17/10, noted recurrence of his atrial fibrillation, called our office this morning, that is despite being on flecainide, atenolol, and he is maintained on coumadin. the patient has noted some lightheadedness as well as chest discomfort and shortness of breath when atrial flutter recurred and we see that on his 12-lead ekg here.  otherwise, no chest pain. past medical history:  significant for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and again he had atrial fibrillation more persistently in 2006, but more recently it has been atrial flutter and that is despite use of antiarrhythmics including flecainide.  he completed a stress test in my office within the past several weeks that was normal without evidence of ischemia.  other medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia. medications:as outpatient,1.  atenolol 25 mg once a day.2.  altace 2.5 mg once a day.3.  zocor 20 mg once a day.4.  flecainide 200 in the morning and 100 in the evening.5.  coumadin as directed by our office. allergies:  to medications are none.  he denies shrimp, sea food or dye allergy. family history:  he has a nephew who was his sister&#8217;s son who passed away at age 22 reportedly from an mi, but was reported to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well.  the patient has previously met with the electrophysiologist, dr. x, at general hospital and it sounds like he had a negative ep study. social history:  the patient does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol nor drink any caffeine.  no use of illicit drugs.  he has been married for 22 years and he is actually accompanied throughout today&#8217;s cardiology consultation by his wife.  he is not participating in regular exercises now because he states since starting flecainide, he has gotten sluggish.  he is employed as an attorney and while he states that overall his mental stress is better, he has noted more recent mental stress this past weekend when he was taking his daughter back to college. review of systems:  he denies any history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi.  there are some questions especially as his wife has told me that he may have obstructive sleep apnea and not had a formal sleep study. physical exam:  blood pressure 156/93, pulse is 100, respiratory rate 18.  on general exam, he is a pleasant overweight gentleman, in no acute distress.  heent:  shows cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  he has moist mucosal membranes.  neck veins are not distended.  there are no carotid bruits.  visible skin warm and perfused.  affect appropriate.  he is quite oriented and pleasant.  no significant kyphoscoliosis on recumbent back exam.  lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  no wheezes.  no egophony.  cardiac exam:  s1, s2.  regular rate, controlled.  no significant murmurs, rubs or gallops.  pmi is nondisplaced.  abdomen is soft, nondistended, appears benign.  extremities without significant edema.  pulses grossly intact. diagnostic studies/lab data:  initial ecg shows atrial flutter. impression:  mr. a is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so.  i have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of.  after in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was i primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as i did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of cva, although we cannot really make that null.  the patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis.  i invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure. procedure note:  the patient received a total of 7 mg of versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the medical center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions.  the patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure.  after the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using &quot;lollipop posterior patch&quot; with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy.  there was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead ekg. impression:  cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on coumadin and his inr is 3.22.  we are going to watch him and discharge him from the medical center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed.  i had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, dr. x, at electrophysiology unit at general hospital and i will be planning to place a call for dr. x myself.  again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and i suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms. i had previously discussed the case with dr. y who is the patient&#8217;s general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient&#8217;s bedside regarding our findings.     <!-- 	cv

~~~ -->     angina is chest pain due to a lack of oxygen to the heart most often occurring in men age 35 or older and postmenopausal women.  it is usually located right under the breast bone.  physical and emotional stress, as well as eating heavy meals, can bring it on.  in a healthy person, these stresses are easily handled.  in a person with an underlying heart condition like coronary artery disease, heart valve problem, arrhythmias or high blood pressure, the heart doesn&#8217;t get enough blood (i.e. not enough oxygen to the heart muscles).  other causes could be due to a hyperactive thyroid disorder or anemia.  people more likely to have angina may also have diabetes mellitus, be overweight, smoke, have a poor diet with lots of salt and fat, fail to exercise, have a stressful workload or have a family history of coronary artery disease. signs and symptoms:*  pain in chest described as tightness, heavy pressure, aching or squeezing.*  the pain sometimes radiates to the jaw, left arm, teeth and/or outer ear.*  possibly a left-sided numbness, tingling, or pain in the arm, shoulder, elbow or chest.*  occasionally a sudden difficulty in breathing occurs.*  pain may be located between the shoulder blades. treatment:*  nitroglycerin relieves the immediate symptoms of angina in seconds.  carry it with you at all times.*  other medications may be prescribed for the underlying heart problems.  it is important to take them as prescribed by your doctor.*  surgery may be necessary to open the blocked coronary arteries (balloon angioplasty) or to bypass them.*  correct the contributing factors you have control over.  lose weight, don&#8217;t smoke, eat a low-salt, low-fat diet and avoid physical and emotional stresses that cause angina.  such stressors include anger, overworking, going between extremes in hot and cold, sudden physical exertion and high altitudes (pressurized airplanes aren&#8217;t a risk).  practice relaxation techniques.*  exercise! discuss first what you are able to do with your doctor and then go do it.*  even with treatment, angina may result in a heart attack, congestive heart failure or a fatal abnormal heartbeat.  treatment decreases the odds that these will occur.*  let your doctor know if your angina doesn&#8217;t go away after 10 minutes, even when you have taken a nitroglycerin tablet.  call if you have repeated chest pains that awaken you from sleep regardless if the nitroglycerin helps.  if your pain changes or feels different, call your doctor or call 911 if the pain is severe.     <!-- 	cv

~~~ -->     re:  sample patient dear sample doctor: thank you for referring mr. sample patient for cardiac evaluation.  this is a 67-year-old, obese male who has a history of therapy-controlled hypertension, borderline diabetes, and obesity.  he has a family history of coronary heart disease but denies any symptoms of angina pectoris or effort intolerance.  specifically, no chest discomfort of any kind, no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed, no orthopnea or pnd.  he is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease.  he has never been a smoker.  he has never had a syncopal episode, mi, or cva.  he had his gallbladder removed.  no bleeding tendencies.  no history of dvt or pulmonary embolism.  the patient is retired, rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately.  he apparently has a sleep disorder, according to his wife (not in the office), the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep.  he is allergic to codeine and aspirin (angioedema). physical exam revealed a middle-aged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches.  his heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular.  his blood pressure was 140/80 mmhg in the right arm in a sitting position and 150/80 mmhg in a standing position.  he is in no distress.  venous pressure is normal.  carotid pulsations are normal without bruits.  the lungs are clear.  cardiac exam was normal.  the abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated.  there were no pulsatile masses or bruits.  the femoral pulses were 3+ in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3+ in character.  there was no peripheral edema.   he had a chemistry profile, which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mg/dl.  renal function was normal.  his lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and hdl and an acceptable range of ldl.  his sodium was a little bit increased.  his a1c hemoglobin was increased.  he had a spirometry, which was reported as normal.   he had a resting electrocardiogram on december 20, 2002, which was also normal.  he had a treadmill cardiolite, which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90% of the predicted maximum heart rate.  there were no symptoms or ischemia by ekg.  there was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by cardiolite imaging. in summary, we have a 67-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease.  i am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity, hypertension, possible insulin resistance, and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia, as well as slight triglyceride elevation.  he denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease, but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis, possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings.   in view of the absence of symptoms, medical therapy is indicated at the present time, with very aggressive risk factor modification.  i explained and discussed extensively with the patient, the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient.  he also should start aggressively losing weight.  i have requested additional testing today, which will include an apolipoprotein b, lpa lipoprotein, as well as homocystine, and cardio crp to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis.   in terms of medication, i have changed his verapamil for a long acting beta-blocker, he should continue on an ace inhibitor and his plavix.  the patient is allergic to aspirin.  i also will probably start him on a statin, if any of the studies that i have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore, if he is confirmed to have diabetes.  along this line, perhaps, we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes, which i believe he should.  this, however, i will leave entirely up to you to decide.  if indeed, he is considered to be a diabetic, a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general, and coronary artery disease in particular. i do not find an indication at this point in time to proceed with any further testing, such as coronary angiography, in the absence of symptoms. if you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to let me know. thank you once again for this kind referral. sincerely, sample doctor, m.d.     <!-- 	cv
~~~ -->     reason for referral:  chest pain, possible syncopal spells. she is a very pleasant 31-year-old mother of two children with add. she was doing okay until january of 2009 when she had a partial hysterectomy.  since then she just says &quot;things have changed&quot;.  she just does not want to go out anymore and just does not feel the same.  also, at the same time, she is having a lot of household stressors with both of her children having add and odd and she feels she does not get enough support from her husband.  her 11-year-old is having a lot of trouble at school and she often has to go there to take care of problems. in this setting, she has been having multiple cardiovascular complaints including chest pains, which feel &quot;like cramps&quot; and sometimes like a dull ache, which will last all day long.  she is also tender in the left breast area and gets numbness in her left hand.  she has also had three spells of &quot;falling&quot;, she is not really clear on whether these are syncopal, but they sound like they could be as she sees spots before her eyes.  twice it happened, when getting up quickly at night and another time in the grocery store.  she suffered no trauma.  she has no remote history of syncope.  her weight has not changed in the past year. medications:  naprosyn, which she takes up to six a day. allergies:  sulfa. social history:  she does not smoke or drink.  she is married with two children. review of systems:  otherwise unremarkable. pex:  bp:  130/70 without orthostatic changes.  pr:  72.  wt:  206 pounds.  she is a healthy young woman.  no jvd.  no carotid bruit.  no thyromegaly.  cardiac:  regular rate and rhythm.  there is no significant murmur, gallop, or rub.  chest:  mildly tender in the upper pectoral areas bilaterally (breast exam was not performed).  lungs:  clear.  abdomen:  soft.  moderately overweight.  extremities:  no edema and good distal pulses. ekg:  normal sinus rhythm, normal ekg. echocardiogram (for syncope):  essentially normal study. impression:1.  syncopal spells &#8211; these do sound, in fact, to be syncopal.  i suspect it is simple orthostasis/vasovagal, as her ekg and echocardiogram looks good.  i have asked her to drink plenty of fluids and to not to get up suddenly at night.  i think this should take care of the problem.  i would not recommend further workup unless these spells continue, at which time i would recommend a tilt-table study.2.  chest pains &#8211; atypical for cardiac etiology, undoubtedly due to musculoskeletal factors from her emotional stressors.  the naprosyn is not helping that much, i gave her a prescription for flexeril and instructed her in its use (not to drive after taking it). recommendations:1.  reassurance that her cardiac checkup looks excellent, which it does.2.  drink plenty of fluids and arise slowly from bed.3.  flexeril 10 mg q 6 p.r.n.4.  i have asked her to return should the syncopal spells continue.     <!-- 	cv

~~~ -->     reason for visit:  this is a routine return appointment for this 71-year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation.  her chief complaint today is shortness of breath. history of present illness:  i last saw her in 09/2008.  since then, she has been admitted to abcd hospital from 11/05/2008 through 11/08/2008 for a near syncopal episode.  she was found to have a fast heart rate in the atrial fibrillation.  she was also found to be in heart failure and so they diuresed her.  they wanted to send her home on furosemide 40 mg daily, but unfortunately they never gave her a prescription for this and so she now is not on any furosemide and since being discharged she has regained fluid to no one&#8217;s great surprise.  my plan advent is to control her heart rate.  this has been a bit difficult with her retaining fluid.  we will try again to diurese her as an outpatient and go forward from there with rate control and anticoagulation.  she may need to have a pacemaker placed and her av node ablated if this does not work. she notes the shortness of breath and wheezing at nights.  i think these are manifestations of heart failure.  she has peripheral edema.  she is short of breath when she tries to walk a city block.  i believe she takes her medications as directed, but i am never sure she actually is taking them correctly.  in any case, she did not bring her medications with her today. today, she had an ecg which shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 117 beats per minute.  there is a nonspecific ivcd.  this is unchanged from her last visit except that her heart rate is faster.  in addition, i reviewed her echocardiogram done at xyz.  her ejection fraction is 50% and she has paradoxical septal motion.  her right ventricular systolic pressure is normal.  there are no significant valvular abnormalities. medications:  1.  fosamax &#8211; 70 mg weekly.2.  lisinopril &#8211; 20 mg daily.3.  metformin &#8211; 850 mg daily.4.  amlodipine &#8211; 5 mg daily.5.  metoprolol &#8211; 150 mg twice daily.6.  warfarin &#8211; 5 mg daily.7.  furosemide &#8211; none.8.  potassium &#8211; none.9.  magnesium oxide &#8211; 200 mg daily. allergies:  denied. major findings:  on my comprehensive cardiovascular examination, she again looks the same which is in heart failure.  her blood pressure today was 130/60 and her pulse 116 blood pressure and regular.  she is 5 feet 11 inches and her weight is 167 pounds, which is up from 158 pounds from when i saw her last visit.  she is breathing 1two times per minute and it is unlabored.  eyelids are normal.  she has vitiligo.  pupils are round and reactive to light.  conjunctivae are clear and sclerae are anicteric.  there is no oral thrush or central cyanosis.  she has marked keloid formation on both sides of her neck, the left being worse than the right.  the jugular venous pressure is elevated.  carotids are brisk are without bruits.  lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.  the precordium is quiet.  the rhythm is irregularly irregular.  she has a variable first and second heart sounds.  no murmurs today.  abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses, although she does have hepatojugular reflux.  she has no clubbing or cyanosis, but does have 1+ peripheral edema.  distal pulses are good.  on neurological examination, her mentation is normal.  her mood and affect are normal.  she is oriented to person, place, and time. assessments:  she has chronic atrial fibrillation and heart failure now. problems diagnoses:  1.  chronic atrial fibrillation, anticoagulated and the plan is rate control.2.  heart failure and she needs more diuretic.3.  high blood pressure controlled.4.  hyperlipidemia.5.  diabetes mellitus type 2.6.  nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.7.  history of alcohol abuse.8.  osteoporosis.9.  normal left ventricular function. procedures and immunizations:  none today. plans:  i have restarted her lasix at 80 mg daily and i have asked her to return in about 10 days to the heart failure clinic.  there, i would like them to recheck her heart rate and if still elevated, and she is truly on 150 mg of metoprolol twice a day, one could switch her amlodipine from 5 mg daily to diltiazem 120 mg daily.  if this does not work, in terms of controlling her heart rate, then she will need to have a pacemaker and her av node ablated. thank you for asking me to participate in her care. medication changes:  see the above.     <!-- 	cv

~~~ -->     history of present illness:  the patient is a 68-year-old woman whom i have been following, who has had angina.  in any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when i spoke to her.  i advised her to call 911, which she did.  while waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain.  by the time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well. past cardiac history:  the patient has been having arm pain for several months.  she underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia.  i had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker.  however, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room.  on 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80%  mid lad lesion, circumflex normal, and rca totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area.  the decision was made to transfer  her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the lad stenosis to the rca vessel.  she underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with i believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08.  she had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild.  yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin.  this is her usual angina.  she is being admitted with unstable angina post stent. past medical history:  longstanding hypertension, cad as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive bladder. medications:1.  detrol la 2 mg once a day.2.  prilosec for gerd 20 mg once a day.3.  glucosamine 500/400 mg once a day for arthritis.4.  multivitamin p.o. daily.5.  nitroglycerin sublingual as available to her.6.  toprol-xl 25 mg once a day which i started although she had been bradycardic, but she seems to be tolerating.7.  aspirin 325 mg once a day.8.  plavix 75 mg once a day.9.  diovan 160 mg once a day.10.  claritin 10 mg once a day for allergic rhinitis.11.  norvasc 5 mg once a day.12.  lipitor 5 mg once a day.13.  evista 60 mg once a day. allergies:  allergies to medications are none.  she denies any shrimp or sea food allergy. family history:  her father died of an mi in his 50s and a brother had his first mi and bypass surgery at 54. social history:  she does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, no use of illicit drugs.  she is divorced and lives alone and is a retired laboratory technician from cornell diagnostic laboratory. review of systems:  she denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting up blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi, cholelithiasis, asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, home oxygen use or sleep apnea, although she has been told in the past that she snores and there was some question of apnea in 05/08.  no morning headaches or fatigue.  no psychiatric diagnosis.  no psoriasis, no lupus.  remainder of the review of systems is negative x14 systems except as described above. physical examination:general:  she is a pleasant elderly woman, currently in no acute distress.vital signs:  height 4 feet 11 inches, weight 128 pounds, temperature 97.2 degrees fahrenheit, blood pressure 142/70, pulse 47,  respiratory rate 16, and o2 saturation 100%heent:  cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  she has moist mucosal membranes.neck:  veins are not distended.  there are no carotid bruits.lungs:  clear to auscultation and percussion without wheezes.heart:  s1 and s2, regular rate.  no significant murmurs, rubs or gallops.  pmi nondisplaced.abdomen:  soft and nondistended.  bowel sounds present.extremities:  without significant clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  pulses grossly intact.  bilateral groins are inspected, status post as the right femoral artery was used for access for the diagnostic cardiac catheterization here and left femoral artery used for pci and there is no evidence of hematoma or bruit and intact distal pulses. laboratory data:  ekg reviewed which shows sinus bradycardia at the rate of 51 beats per minute and no acute disease. sodium 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 105, and bicarbonate 27.  bun 16 and creatinine 0.9.  glucose 110.  magnesium 2.5.  alt 107 and ast 65 and these were normal on 08/15/08.  inr is 0.89, ptt 20.9, white blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08/15/08, and platelet count 257,000. impression and plan:  the patient is a 68-year-old woman with exertional angina, characterized with arm pain, who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery.  in any case, given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, i am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy.  we will continue her beta-blocker and i cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already.  aspirin, plavix, valsartan, lipitor, and norvasc.  i am going to add imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out mi, although there is a little suspicion.  i suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect.  my concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal lv function.  she will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis, claritin for allergies, and detrol la for urinary incontinence. total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes.  all this was discussed in detail with the patient and her daughter who expressed understanding and agreement.  the patient desires full resuscitation status.     <!-- 	cv

~~~ -->     history of present illness:  the patient is a 74-year-old white woman who has a past medical history of hypertension for 15 years, history of cva with no residual hemiparesis and uterine cancer with pulmonary metastases, who presented for evaluation of recent worsening of the hypertension.  according to the patient, she had stable blood pressure for the past 12-15 years on 10 mg of lisinopril.  in august of 2007, she was treated with doxorubicin and, as well as procrit and her blood pressure started to go up to over 200s.  her lisinopril was increased to 40 mg daily.  she was also given metoprolol and hctz two weeks ago, after she visited the emergency room with increased systolic blood pressure.  denies any physical complaints at the present time.  denies having any renal problems in the past. past medical history:  as above plus history of anemia treated with procrit.  no smoking or alcohol use and lives alone. family history:  unremarkable. present medications:  as above. review of systems:  cardiovascular:  no chest pain.  no palpitations.  pulmonary:  no shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing.  gastrointestinal:  no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  gu:  no nocturia.  denies having gross hematuria.  salt intake is minimal.  neurological:  unremarkable, except for history of old cva. physical examination:  blood pressure today is 182/78.  examination of the head is unremarkable.  neck is supple with no jvd.  lungs are clear.  there is no abdominal bruit.  extremities 1+ edema bilaterally. laboratory data:  urinalysis done in the office shows 1+ proteinuria; same is shown by urinalysis done at hospital.  the creatinine is 0.8.  renal ultrasound showed possible renal artery stenosis and a 2 cm cyst in the left kidney.  mra of the renal arteries was essentially unremarkable with no suspicion for renal artery stenosis. impression and plan:  accelerated hypertension.  no clear-cut etiology for recent worsening since renal artery stenosis was ruled out by negative mra.  i could only blame procrit initiation, as well as possible fluid retention as a cause of the patient&#8217;s accelerated hypertension.  she was started on hydrochlorothiazide less than two weeks ago with some improvement in her hypertension.  at this point, i would not pursue a diagnosis of renal artery stenosis.  since she is maxed out on lisinopril and her pulse is 60, i would not increase beta-blocker or ace inhibitor.  i will continue hctz at 24 mg daily.  the patient was also given a sample of tekturna, which would hopefully improve her systolic blood pressure.  the patient was told to be stick with her salt intake.  she will report to me in 10 days with the result of her blood pressure.  she will also repeat an sma7 to rule out possible hyperkalemia due to tekturna.     <!-- 	cv
~~~ -->     history of present illness:  the patient is a charming and delightful 46-year-old woman admitted with palpitations and presyncope. the patient is active and a previously healthy young woman, who has had nine years of occasional palpitations.  symptoms occur three to four times per year and follow no identifiable pattern.  she has put thought and effort in trying to identify precipitating factors or circumstances but has been unable to do so.  symptoms can last for an hour or more and she feels as if her heart is going very rapidly but has never measured her heart rate.  the last two episodes, the most recent of which was yesterday, were associated with feeling of darkness descending as if a shade was being pulled down in front of her vision.  on neither occasion did she lose consciousness. yesterday, she had a modestly active morning taking a walk with her dogs and performing her normal routines.  while working on a computer, she had a spell.  palpitations persisted for a short time thereafter as outlined in the hospital&#8217;s admission note prompting her to seek evaluation at the hospital.  she was in sinus rhythm on arrival and has been asymptomatic since. no history of exogenous substance abuse, alcohol abuse, or caffeine abuse.  she does have a couple of sodas and at least one to two coffees daily.  she is a nonsmoker.  she is a mother of two.  there is no family history of congenital heart disease.  she has had no history of thoracic trauma.  no symptoms to suggest thyroid disease. no known history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia.  family history is negative for ischemic heart disease. remote history is significant for an acl repair, complicated by contact urticaria from a neoprene cast. no regular medications prior to admission. the only allergy is the neoprene reaction outlined above. physical examination:  vital signs as charted.  pupils are reactive.  sclerae nonicteric.  mucous membranes are moist.  neck veins not distended.  no bruits.  lungs are clear.  cardiac exam is regular without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  abdomen is soft without guarding, rebound masses, or bruits.  extremities well perfused.  no edema.  strong and symmetrical distal pulses. a 12-lead ekg shows sinus rhythm with normal axis and intervals.  no evidence of preexcitation. laboratory studies:  unremarkable.  no evidence of myocardial injury.  thyroid function is pending. two-dimensional echocardiogram shows no evidence of clinically significant structural or functional heart disease. impression/plan:  episodic palpitations over a nine-year period.  outpatient workup would be appropriate.  event recorder should be obtained and the patient can be seen again in the office upon completion of that study.  suppressive medication (beta-blocker or cardizem) was discussed with the patient for symptomatic improvement, though this would be unlikely to be a curative therapy.  the patient expresses a preference to avoid medical therapy if possible. thank you for this consultation.  we will be happy to follow her both during this hospitalization and following discharge.  caffeine avoidance was discussed as well. addendum:  during her initial evaluation, a d-dimer was mildly elevated to 5.  ct scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  lower extremity venous ultrasound is pending; however, in the absence of embolization to the pulmonary vasculature, this would be an unlikely cause of palpitations.  in addition, no progression over the nine-year period that she has been symptomatic suggests that this is an unlikely cause.     <!-- 	cv

chair and could not get herself off the floor.  she states that 1-1/2 hours later she was able to get herself off the floor. the patient denies any chest pain nor clear shortness of breath. past medical history:  includes, end-stage renal disease from hypertension.  she follows up with dr. x in her office and has been known to have a small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion since 11/07 that has apparently been followed and it appears that the patient was not interested in having diagnostic pericardiocentesis done.  she had an echocardiogram today (please see also that report), which shows stable and small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion without tamponade, normal left ventricular ejection fraction at 55% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly dilated right ventricular size, normal right ventricular ejection fraction, moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension, estimated pa systolic pressure of 71 mmhg when compared to the prior echocardiogram done 08/29/07, previously the mitral regurgitation was mild and previously the pa systolic pressure was estimated at 90 mmhg.  other findings were not significantly changed including pericardial effusion description.  she has a history of longstanding hypertension.  she has been on hemodialysis since 1997 for renal failure, history of mini-strokes documented several years ago, history of seizure disorder, she has a history of right upper extremity edema and right breast enlargement from right subclavian vein occlusion.  she has a history of hypertension, depression, hyperlipidemia, on sensipar for tertiary hyperparathyroidism. past surgical history:  includes, cholecystectomy, post fistula in the left arm, which has failed, and right arm, which is being used including number of operative procedures to the fistula.  she follows up with dr. y regarding neurovascular surgery. medications:  on admission:1.  norvasc 10 mg

patient becomes quite sleepy when i am talking. social history:  unable to obtain as the patient becomes quite sleepy when i am talking. review of systems:  unable to obtain as the patient becomes quite sleepy when i am talking. physical exam:  temperature 99.2, blood pressure ranges from 88/41 to 108/60, pulse 70, respiratory rate, 20, o2 saturation 98%.  height is 5 feet 1 inch, weight 147 pounds.  on general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who does arouse to voice, but then becomes quite sleepy and apparently that is an improvement from when she was admitted.  heent shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  she has moist mucosal membranes.  neck veins are difficult to assess, but do not appear clinically distended.  no carotid bruits.  lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  no wheezes.  cardiac exam:  s1, s2 regular rate, 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard with radiation from the left apex towards the left axilla.  no rub, no gallop.  pmi is nondisplaced.  abdomen:  soft, nondistended.  cva is benign.  extremities with no significant edema.  pulses appear grossly intact.  she has evidence of right upper extremity edema, which is apparently chronic. diagnostic data/lab data:  ekgs are reviewed including from 07/07/09 at 08:31 a.m., which shows atrial fibrillation with left anterior fascicular block, poor r-wave progression when compared to one done on 07/06/09 at 18:25, there is really no significant change.  the atrial fibrillation appears present since at least on ekg done on 11/02/07 and this ekg is not significantly changed from the most recent one.  echocardiogram results as above.  chest x-ray shows mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  bnp shows 3788.  sodium 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 94, bicarbonate 23, bun 49, creatinine 5.90.  troponin was 0.40 followed by 0.34.  inr 1.03 on 05/18/07.  white blood cell count 9.4, hematocrit 42, platelet count 139. impression:  ms. abc is a 74-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a fall and she has a history of vascular dementia, so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time.  she does have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and i found an ekg report by dr. x, which shows atrial fibrillation on 08/29/07 per her report.  one of the questions we were asked was whether the patient would be a candidate for coumadin.  clearly given her history of small mini-strokes, i think coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation, but the main issue is the fall risk.  if not felt to be significant fall risk then i would strongly recommend coumadin as the patient herself states that she has only fallen twice in the past year.  i would defer that decision to dr. z and dr. xy who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate. recommendations:1.  fall assessment as per dr. z and dr. xy with possible pt consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk, would put her on coumadin.  given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation, she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol.2.  the patient has elevated bnp and i suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal lv function, i would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis.3.  regarding this minimal troponin elevation, i do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her small-to-moderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what i can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade.  i would defer to her usual cardiologist dr. x whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification.  i did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 08/07 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall, but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal lv function seen on that study as well.4.  continue norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol.5.  the patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary cva, thromboprophylaxis (albeit understanding that it is inferior to coumadin).6.  continue dilantin for history of seizures.     <!-- 	cv

taken to the cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was then used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery.  once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  a steel guidewire was then inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  a small nick was then made in the skin and its pressure was held.  the needle was removed over the guidewire.  a #6 french sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  the guidewire and dilator were then removed.  the sheath was then flushed.  next, angulated pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of the guidewire.  the catheter was then advanced into the left ventricle.  the guidewire was then removed.  the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  lvedp was then measured and found to be favorable for a left ventriculogram.  the left ventriculogram was performed in the rao position with a single power injection of non-ionic contrast material.  lvedp was then remeasured.  pullback was then performed, which failed to reveal an lvao gradient.  the catheter was then removed.  next, a judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  the guidewire was removed.  the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material, the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was removed.  next, a judkins right #4 catheter was then advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  the guidewire was removed.  the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  the ostium of the saphenous vein graft was engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  the saphenous vein graft was visualized in several different views.  the judkins right catheter was then advanced and the native coronary artery was engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  right coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was retracted.  we were unable to engage the left subclavian artery thus the catheter was removed over an exchange wire.  next, a multipurpose catheter was advanced over the exchange wire.  the wire was then easily passed into the left subclavian artery.  the multipurpose catheter was then removed.  lima catheter was then exchanged over the wire into the left subclavian artery.  the guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  lima graft was then engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  the lima graft was evaluated in several different views.  once adequate study has been performed, the lima catheter was retracted under fluoroscopic guidance.  the sheath was flushed for the final time.  the patient was returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable and satisfactory condition. findings:left ventriculogram:  there is no evidence of any wall motion abnormalities with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%.  left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 24 mmhg preinjection and 26 mmhg postinjection.  there is no

~~~ -->     procedure:  left heart catheterization, left ventriculography, selective coronary angiography. indication:  this lady with a previous left internal mammary graft to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse margin branch, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch, and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery presented with recurrent difficulties with breathing.  this was felt to be related largely to chronic obstructive lung disease.  she had dynamic t-wave changes in precordial leads.  cardiac enzymes were indeterminate.  she was evaluated by dr. x and given her previous history and multiple risk factors it was elected to proceed with cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. risks of the procedure including risks of conscious sedation, death, cerebrovascular accident, dye reaction, need for emergency surgery, vascular access injury and/or infection, and risks of cath-based interventions were discussed in detail.  the patient understood and agreed to proceed. description of the procedure:  the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.  under versed and fentanyl sedation, the right groin was sterilely prepped and draped.  local anesthesia was obtained with 2% xylocaine.  the right femoral artery was entered using modified seldinger technique and a 4-french introducer sheath placed in that vessel.  through the indwelling femoral arterial sheath, a jl4 4-french catheter was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta, appropriately aspirated and flushed.  ascending aortic root pressures obtained.  this catheter was utilized in an attempt to cannulate the left coronary ostium.  this catheter was too small, was exchanged for a jl5 4-french catheter, which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta, the cath appropriately aspirated and flushed, and advanced to left coronary ostium and multiple views of left coronary artery obtained. this catheter was then exchanged for a 4-french right coronary catheter, which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta.  the catheter appropriately aspirated and flushed.  the catheter was advanced in the right coronary artery.  multiple views of that vessel were obtained.  the catheter was then sequentially advanced to the saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch, and left internal mammary artery, left anterior descending coronary artery, and multiple views of those vessels were obtained.  this catheter was then exchanged for a 4-french pigtail catheter, which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta.  the catheter was appropriately aspirated and flushed and advanced to left ventricle, baseline left ventricular pressures obtained. following this, left ventriculography was performed in a 30-degree rao projection using 30 ml of contrast injected over 3 seconds.  post left ventriculography pressures were then obtained as was a pullback pressure across the aortic valve.  videotapes were then reviewed.  it was elected to terminate the procedure at that point in time. the vascular sheath was removed and manual compression carried out.  excellent hemostasis was obtained.  the patient tolerated the procedure without complication. results of procedure1.  hemodynamics:  left ventricular end-diastolic filling pressure was

~~~ -->     procedure:  left heart catheterization, left and right coronary angiography, left ventricular angiography, and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary artery. procedure in detail:  the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory.  after informed consent, he was medicated with versed and fentanyl.  the right groin was prepped and draped, and infiltrated with 2% xylocaine.  percutaneously, #6-french arterial sheath was placed.  selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography.  the patient had a totally occluded right coronary.  we initially started with a jr4 guide.  we were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis.  we were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated.  we then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis, but we had very little guide support, the guide kept coming out.  we then switched to an al1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion.  we finally had to go an al2 guide, we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection.  that guided seated, we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis, and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip.  the surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open, but we were able to re-cross with a sport wire.  we then re-dilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support, we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm vision stent, where the lesion was and post-dilated it to 18 atmospheres.  routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded, whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear, but we were able to re-wire that area and get a 25 x12 vision balloon and dilate the area and re-establish flow to the small segment.  we then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm vision stent at 18 atmospheres.  final angiography showed resolution of the dissection.  we could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent.  no perforation and excellent flow.  during the intervention, we did give a bolus and drip of angiomax.  at the end of the procedure, we stopped the angiomax and gave 600 mg of plavix.  we did a right femoral angiogram; however, the angio-seal plug could not take, so we used manual pressure and a femostop.  we transported the patient to his room in stable condition. angiographic data:  left main coronary is normal.  left anterior descending artery has a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60% stenosis of the lad before it bifurcates into diagonal.  the diagonal does appear to have about 50% osteal stenosis.  there is a lot of plaquing further down the diagonal, but good flow.  the rest of the lad looked good pass the proximal 60% stenosis and after the diagonal branch.  circumflex artery was nondominant vessel, consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel.  the first obtuse marginal had a long 50% narrowing and then the av groove branch was free of any disease.  some mild collaterals to the right were seen.  right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary, just about 0.5 cm after its origin.  after we got a wire across the area of occlusion, we could see some thrombosis and a 99% stenosis just at the curve.  following the balloon angioplasty, we established good flow down the distal vessel.  we still had about residual 70% stenosis.  when we had to go back with the al2 guide, we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection.  we re-dilated and then deployed.  repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally.  we never did have the wire that far down, so this was probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus.  after deploying the stent, we had total resolution of the original lesion.  we then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch, which the remainder of the vessel was patent giving off a large pda.  the posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in its mid portion.  we got a wire through and dilated this.  we then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent.  repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection, a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch, but this was excluded by the stent.  there were no filling defects in the stent and excellent flow.  the distal posterolateral branch did open up, although it was little under-filled and there may have been some mild residual disease there. impression:  atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary, successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection.  minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60% proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50% diagonal stenosis along with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch.     <!-- 	cv

~~~ -->     procedures:  esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy with biopsy and polypectomy. reason for procedure:  child with abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.  rule out inflammatory bowel disease, allergic enterocolitis, rectal polyps, and rectal vascular malformations. consent:  history and physical examination was performed.  the procedure, indications, alternatives available, and complications, i.e. bleeding, perforation, infection, adverse medication reaction, the possible need for blood transfusion, and surgery should a complication occur were discussed with the parents who understood and indicated this.  opportunity for questions was provided and informed consent was obtained. medication:  general anesthesia. instrument:  olympus gif-160. complications:  none. findings:  with the patient in the supine position and intubated, the endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx.  the esophageal mucosa and vascular pattern appeared normal.  the lower esophageal sphincter was located at 25 cm from the central incisors.  it appeared normal.  a z-line was identified within the lower esophageal sphincter.  the endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which distended with excess air.  rugal folds flattened completely.  gastric mucosa appeared normal throughout.  no hiatal hernia was noted.  pyloric valve appeared normal.  the endoscope was advanced into the first, second, and third portions of duodenum, which had normal mucosa, coloration, and fold pattern.  biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of duodenum, antrum, and distal esophagus at 22 cm from the central incisors for histology.  additional 2 biopsies were obtained for clo testing in the antrum.  excess air was evacuated from the stomach.  the scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of procedure well.  the patient was turned and the scope was advanced with some difficulty to the terminal ileum.  the terminal ileum mucosa and the colonic mucosa throughout was normal except at approximately 10 cm where a 1 x 1 cm pedunculated juvenile-appearing polyp was noted.  biopsies were obtained x2 in the terminal ileum, cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid, and rectum.  then, the polyp was snared right at the base of the polyp on the stalk and 20 watts of pure coag was applied in 2-second bursts x3.  the polyp was severed.  there was no bleeding at the stalk after removal of the polyp head.  the polyp head was removed by suction.  excess air was evacuated from the colon.  the patient tolerated that part of the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition.  estimated blood loss approximately 5 ml. impression:  normal esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and colon as well as terminal ileum except for a 1 x 1-cm rectal polyp, which was removed successfully by polypectomy snare. plan:  histologic evaluation and clo testing.  i will contact the parents next week with biopsy results and further management plans will be discussed at that time.     <!-- 	gi
~~~ -->     preoperative diagnosis:  blood loss anemia. postoperative diagnoses:1.  normal colon with no evidence of bleeding.2.  hiatal hernia.3.  fundal gastritis with polyps.4.  antral mass. anesthesia:  conscious sedation with demerol and versed. specimen:  antrum and fundal polyps. history:  the patient is a 66-year-old african-american female who presented to abcd hospital with mental status changes.  she has been anemic as well with no gross evidence of blood loss.  she has had a decreased appetite with weight loss greater than 20 lb over the past few months.  after discussion with the patient and her daughter, she was scheduled for egd and colonoscopy for evaluation. procedure:  after informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  she was placed in the left lateral position and was given iv demerol and versed for sedation.  when adequate level of sedation was achieved, a digital rectal exam was performed, which demonstrated no masses and no hemorrhoids.  the colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and air was insufflated.  the scope was coursed through the rectum and sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon to the level of the cecum.  there were no polyps, masses, diverticuli, or areas of inflammation.  the scope was then slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  air was aspirated.  once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed.  there was no evidence of perianal disease.  no source of the anemia was identified. attention was then taken for performing an egd.  the gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and was entered into the hypopharynx.  the esophagus was easily intubated and traversed.  there were no abnormalities of the esophagus.  the stomach was entered and was insufflated.  the scope was coursed along the greater curvature towards the antrum.  adjacent to the pylorus, towards the anterior surface, was a mass like lesion with a central _______.  it was not clear if this represents a healing ulcer or neoplasm.  several biopsies were taken.  the mass was soft.  the pylorus was then entered.  the duodenal bulb and sweep were examined.  there was no evidence of mass, ulceration, or bleeding.  the scope was then brought back into the antrum and was retroflexed.  in the fundus and body, there was evidence of streaking and inflammation.  there were also several small sessile polyps, which were removed with biopsy forceps.  biopsy was also taken for clo.  a hiatal hernia was present as well.  air was aspirated.  the scope was slowly withdrawn.  the ge junction was unremarkable.  the scope was fully withdrawn.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  she will undergo a cat scan of her abdomen and pelvis to further assess any possible adenopathy or gastric obstructional changes.  we will await the biopsy reports and further recommendations will follow.     <!-- 	gi
~~~ -->     indication:      recurrent dysphagia. premedications:  see procedure nurse ncs form.  procedure:  consent par conference was held.  after signing the informed consent, premedications were given.  the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and monitored with blood pressure cuff and pulse oximeter throughout the procedure.  hurricaine spray was placed in the back of the throat.  the olympus endoscope was passed under direct visualization through the cricopharyngeus into the esophageal area.  it was passed through the esophagus with identification of the eg junction and into the stomach.  a portion of the stomach and the rugal folds were visualized.  the scope was passed into the antral area with visualization of the pylorus.  the pylorus was cannulated and the duodenal bulb and the second position of the duodenum were visualized.  the scope was passed back into the stomach where the cardia, fundus, and lesser curvature were visualized in a retrograde manner.  the following findings were noted:   findings:  1.  the esophagus was significantly tortuous and somewhat shortened with a large hiatal hernia with the eg junction at approximately 30 cm.  it was difficult to tell if there was significant narrowing in the esophagus with the significant tortuosity and the scope passing into the stomach.  no resistance was noted to the endoscope.2.  the stomach was abnormal with a very large sliding type hiatal hernia.3.  the duodenum was normal.4.  a savary wire was placed in the antrum and the scope was removed.  positioning the wire by markings, a #14 french dilator was passed without difficulty into the stomach area.  there was some resistance to a #16 french dilator, although at that time it had passed to approximately 40 cm and i suspect we were through the eg junction area.  this may have been curling in the hiatal hernia, i opted not to use further force to advance the dilator further. the scope was removed and the patient tolerated the procedure well.   impression:  very large hiatal hernia and tortuous esophagus, probably with mild peptic stricture, dilated to #14 french.  i may even have gotten the #16 french dilator through, but it was not passed all the way into the stomach area because of some resistance which i suspect was curling in the hiatal hernia. plan:  i will have her follow up with my nurse practitioner in approximately 10 days.  if her dysphagia is improved, we will simply observe.  if she continues to have dysphagia, we will bring her back and attempt to re-dilate her with a #15 french dilator.  she will continue aciphex long term.     <!-- 	gi

~~~ -->     problem:  chronic abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abnormal liver function tests. history:  the patient is a 23-year-old female referred for evaluation due to a chronic history of abdominal pain and extensive work-up for abnormal liver function tests and this chronic nausea and vomiting referred here for further evaluation due to the patient&#8217;s recent move from eugene to portland.  the patient is not a great historian.  most of the history is obtained through the old history and chart that the patient has with her.  according to what we can make out, she began experiencing nausea, vomiting, recurrent epigastric and right upper quadrant pain in 2001.  she was initially seen by dr. a back in september 2001 for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  during those times, it was suspected that part of her symptoms may be secondary to biliary disease and underwent a cholecystectomy performed in oregon by dr.  a in august 2001.  it was assumed that this was caused by biliary dyskinesia.  previous to that, an upper endoscopy was performed by dr. b in july 2001 that showed to be mild gastritis secondary to anti-inflammatory use.  postoperatively she continued to have nausea and vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain and epigastric pain similar to her gallbladder pain in the past.    in addition, she had significant abnormal liver function tests with alt in the 600&#8242;s, ast 300&#8242;s with a bilirubin 2.5 and alkaline phosphatase in the 200&#8242;s.  ultrasound shows common bile duct of 6 mm post cholecystectomy.  the patient was then eventually referred to dr. w in oregon.  given the abnormal liver function tests and abnormal ultrasound, dr. w performed an ercp with sphincterotomy  in september 20, 2001.  because of the symptoms and the suspicions of sphincter of oddi dysfunction, a sphincterotomy was performed during the ercp.  procedure was uneventful.  the patient did well for a few months, but unfortunately got hospitalized again in may 2002 for recurrence of the abdominal pain and markedly elevated liver function tests with alt in the 600 to 900 range, again with nausea and vomiting.  after transient elevation, her liver function tests would normalize.   during her hospitalization, extensive work-up including ct scan, 24 hour urine collection for porphyrins, a percutaneous liver biopsy, and hepatitis panel, all of which were normal.  a repeat ercp with placement of endobiliary stent was uneventful and did not show evidence of pbc or psc.  after placement of the biliary stent, according to dr. w&#8217;s note, it apparently helped the patient with her symptoms with decreased frequency of nausea, vomiting, and pain.  mri of the abdomen was also performed in may 2002 showing a horseshoe kidney, which was previously known on old ct scans.  while the biliary stent was in place, the patient did have recurrent bouts of nausea and vomiting and pain rated 7 out of 10 in intensity.   finally in august 2002, the endobiliary stent was removed and there were no signs of obstruction.  thereafter, the patient actually did fairly well for about a year, but because of a recurrence of her symptoms, dr. w actually sent the patient up to ohsu for evaluation of this continued fairly mysterious abdominal pain.  the patient states that she saw dr. a who recommended some laboratory tests and a repeat ercp for further evaluation, but the patient did not want to go up to ohsu as she was somewhat unhappy with initial care.   then, over the course of the next several month, at the beginning of 2004, the patient&#8217;s symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and recurrence abdominal pain returned.  in fact, recently as the last documentation in may and june, the patient visited emergency room several times due to her symptoms.  lab tests show normal cbc with no signs of elevated white count.  ast and alt were normal.  alkaline phosphatase was in the low 200&#8242;s with minimally elevated lipase of 78.  bilirubin was completely normal.  the patient was given some zofran and that seemed to control her symptoms and then she was discharged and now referred to us for further evaluation.  at the present time, the patient is not having any abdominal pain.  she states she threw up three times in the morning and is feeling well at this point.  her abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting symptoms are random.  it does not associate with food.  it is not pre or post meal and occasionally will wake her up in the middle of the night.  she has not lost any weight despite this chronic nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain.  her bowel habits have been fairly normal.  no hematemesis or melena.  no rashes, joint pain, or other symptoms have been noted.   allergies:  the patient has allergies to sulfa and codeine.   operations:  laparoscopic cholecystectomy, two ercp&#8217;s including stent placement and sphincterotomy. illnesses:  juvenile rheumatoid arthritis for which dr. b is following. medications:  the patient is on some type of anti-inflammatory, for which the name is unknown to her.  she is also taking some zofran.   habits:  she does not drink or smoke.   social history:  the patent moved up from eugene.  she currently lives up here and works in portland.   family history:  noncontributory. review of systems:  the patient has seen primarily dr. b, her rheumatologist, as primary care. data:  the patient&#8217;s extensive chart was reviewed.  it took over 45 minutes to sort through the chart and the labs.  physical examination:   the patient is a  23-year old female who appears well developed with no acute signs of distress.  hent:  normocephalic, atraumatic, perrla, eomi, sclerae are anicteric.  nares are patent and symmetrical.  the oropharynx is clear with moist mucus membranes and no obvious mucosal lesions.  the tongue is midline.  neck:  supple without adenopathy, jvd, or thyromegaly.  there&#8217;s no supraclavicular adenopathy.  lungs:  clear bilaterally with normal respiratory effort.  back:  nontender to palpation and there&#8217;s no cva tenderness or obvious spinal deformity.  cardiac:  regular rate and rhythm. no murmur.  abdomen:  soft, nondistended and nontender to palpation throughout with no appreciable hepatosplenomegaly, masses, fullness or ascites.  bowel sounds were present and did appear normal.  rectal:  deferred.  extremities:  without edema, calf tenderness or joint swelling.  neurologic:  shows the patient to be alert and oriented x&#8217;s 3 with normal gait.  skin:  warm and dry with normal color and no rashes.  impression:  a 23-year-old female with fairly mysterious symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain status post cholecystectomy and ercp with sphincterotomy.  she continues to have very intermittent elevated liver function tests and symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.  there was some discussion with dr. w in the past regarding extending the sphincterotomy to ensure that a complete sphincterotomy was performed if the patient should have sphincter of oddi dysfunction, however, at this time i am reluctant to do so without further reviewing the patient&#8217;s chart and investigating other avenues.  i think we will check another repeat liver function test and i think it may be helpful to repeat a liver biopsy to ensure we are not missing other primary liver diseases before concentrating purely on the biliary tree itself.  in addition, ama will be obtained along with a liver function test.  i would also like to obtain some discharge summaries from dr. w&#8217;s office to further clarify what has transpired over the past three years.   plan:  1.  obtain discharge summaries from dr. w&#8217;s office.2.  send the patient for a complete metabolic panel, ama.3.  send the patient for ultrasound and possible ultrasound guided liver biopsy.4.  the patient will return to see me in three weeks.  we will consider further options pending on these results of the test and review of the patient&#8217;s discharge summaries from dr. w&#8217;s office.  if the patient should show symptoms of pain and elevated liver function tests to be consistent with sphincter of oddi dysfunction, we may repeat the ercp and extend the sphincterotomy.  the entire case was discussed with the patient.  the patient is agreeable to the current plan.  thank you for this consultation.   followup:  in two to three weeks.     <!-- 	gi

bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently.  he has not had any rectal bleeding. he asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with iv insertion.  he has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes.  the tenderness has now completely resolved.   he had a colonoscopy performed in august of 2003, by dr. s.  an anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction.  dr. s recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation.  no active crohn&#8217;s disease was found during the colonoscopy.   earlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests.  at that time he was taking a lot of tylenol for migraine-type headaches.  under dr. s&#8217;s recommendation, he stopped the imuran for one month and reduced his dose of tylenol.  since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the imuran with no problems.   he also reports heartburn that is occurring on a slightly more frequent basis than it has in the past.  it used to occur once a week only, but has now increased in frequency to twice a week.  he takes over-the-counter h2 blockers as needed, as well as tums.  he associates the onset of his symptoms with eating spicy mexican food. past medical history:  reviewed and unchanged. allergies:  no known allergies to medications. operations:  unchanged. illnesses:  crohn&#8217;s disease, vitamin b12 deficiency. medications:  imuran, nascobal, vicodin p.r.n. review of systems:  dated 08/04/04 is reviewed and noted.  please see pertinent gi issues as discussed above.  otherwise unremarkable. physical examination:   general:  pleasant male in no acute distress.  well nourished and well developed. skin: indurated, cord-like superficial vein on the right anterior forearm, approx. 3 cm in length.  non-tender to palpation. no erythema or red streaking.  no edema. lymph:  no epitrochlear or axillary lymph node enlargement or tenderness on the right side.  data reviewed: labs from june 8th and july 19th reviewed.  liver function tests normal with ast 14 and alt 44.  wbcs were slightly low at 4.8.  hemoglobin dropped slightly from 14.1 on 6/8 to 12.9 on 7/19. hematocrit dropped slightly as well from 43.2 on 6/804 to 40.0 on 7/19/04.  these results were reviewed by dr. s and lab results letter sent. impression:  1. crohn&#8217;s disease, status post terminal ileum resection, on imuran.  intermittent symptoms of bowel obstruction.  last episode three weeks ago.2.  history of non-specific hepatitis while taking high doses of tylenol.  now resolved. 2.  increased frequency of reflux symptoms.3.  superficial thrombophlebitis, resolving. 4.  slightly low h&#038;h. plan:  1.  we discussed dr. s&#8217;s recommendation that the patient undergo balloon dilation for recurrent bowel obstruction type symptoms.  the patient emphatically states that he does not want to consider dilation at this time.  the patient is strongly encouraged to call us when he does experience any obstructive symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits.  he states understanding of this. advised to maintain low residue diet to avoid obstructions. 2.  continue with liver panel and abc every month per dr. s&#8217;s instructions.3.  continue imuran 100 mg per day.4.  continue to minimize tylenol use.  the patient is wondering if he can take another type of medication for migraines that is not tylenol or antiinflammatories or aspirin.  dr. s is consulted and agrees that imitrex is an acceptable alternative for migraine headaches since he does not have advanced liver disease. the patient will make an appointment with his primary care provider to discuss this further. 5.  reviewed the importance of prophylactic treatment of reflux-type symptoms.  encouraged the patient to take over-the-counter h2 blockers on a daily basis to prevent symptoms from occurring.  the patient will try this and if he remains symptomatic, then he will call our office and a prescription for zantac 150 mg per day will be provided.  reviewed the potential need for upper endoscopy should his symptoms continue or become more frequent.  he does not want to undergo any type of procedure such as that at this time.6.    his thrombophlebitis appears to be resolving and does not have any alarming features present.  no treatment is needed at this time. he is instructed to call our office or his pcp if he experiences any pain, red streaking or fever. 7.  we will watch his cbc carefully to ensure that the h&#038;h does not continue to drop.  if it does, then he may need further evaluation with iron studies, b12 levels, or a gi evaluation.   followup:  continue liver panel and abc every month; follow up pending these results.  call our office for obstructive symptoms or continued reflux.  otherwise prescription evaluation in one year.     <!-- 	gi
~~~ -->     operation1.  ivor-lewis esophagogastrectomy.2.  feeding jejunostomy.3.  placement of two right-sided #28-french chest tubes.4.  right thoracotomy. anesthesia:  general endotracheal anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube. operative procedure in detail:  after obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed.  in addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  the patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  his abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  after applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  dissection was carried down through the linea using bovie electrocautery.  the abdomen was opened.  next, a balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  in an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  we incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  the omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  we did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  next, we turned our attention to performing a kocher maneuver.  this was done and the stomach was freed up.  we took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  we enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  we also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  the esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  we next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  the left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  we first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  the left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  at this point the stomach was freely mobile.  we then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  a 2-0 vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of treitz.  we then used bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  we placed a 16-french red rubber catheter through this site.  we tied down in place.  we then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a witzel.  next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  after doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  this was done with #1 prolene.  we put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 vicryl.  the skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl. next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  the right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  we then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with bovie electrocautery.  next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  the lung was deflated.  we placed standard chest retractors.  next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  we dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  the azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  as mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  after doing this, we backed our ng tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  we used an automatic pursestring and applied.  we then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with metzenbaum scissors.  we secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  the pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 gia stapler.  after doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using bovie electrocautery.  we placed our eea stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  we connected our anvil to the eea stapler.  this was then secured appropriately.  we checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  we then fired the stapler.  we obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  we also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  we then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  this was closed with 2-0 vicryl in a running fashion.  we then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 vicryl interrupted sutures.  we returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  next, we placed two #28-french chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  we then closed the chest with #2 vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  the lung was brought up.  we closed the muscle layers with #0 vicryl followed by #0 vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 vicryl and the skin with 4-0 monocryl.  sterile dressing was applied.  the instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the icu in good condition.     <!-- 	gi

~~~ -->     preoperative diagnoses:  1.  congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax.2.  rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak. postoperative diagnoses:  diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia. anesthesia:  general. indication:  the patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites.  the patient has been treated somewhat successfully with tpn and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces.  last week, dr. x took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically.  however at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen.  dr. x opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole.  this was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease.  we met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt. operative findings:  the patient&#8217;s abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended.  exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity.  what we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon.  it appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery.  there was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but i did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient&#8217;s small bowel would be viable surgical option.  instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that. the lymphatic abnormality was extensive.  they were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery.  they were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well.  no other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified.  both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well. description of operation:  the patient was brought from the pediatric intensive care unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow.  we conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient&#8217;s important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above.  preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia.  as the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described.  the bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient&#8217;s chylous ascites.  the small bowel from the ligament of treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for the patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems.  furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option.  we suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient&#8217;s abdominal incision with 4-0 pds on the posterior sheath and 3-0 pds on the anterior rectus sheath.  subcuticular 5-0 monocryl and steri-strips were used for skin closure. the patient tolerated the procedure well.  he lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 ml of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak.  the patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an intestinal transplantation center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time.     <!-- 	gi

~~~ -->     month dd, yyyy xyz re:  abcmedical record#:  123 dear dr. xyz: i saw abc back in neuro-oncology clinic today.  he comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma. within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion.  the patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent.  it is clear that his mri is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.  despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time. after seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen.  they came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.  they then wanted another mri to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation. from my view, i noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since i last saw him.  this is very worrisome.  today, for the first time, i felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well.  therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor.  it suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future. emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids i once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation.  despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible.  it is not that he does not want treatment, however.  because i told him that i did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to temodar in a low dose daily type regimen.  we would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days.  in addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day.  if he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us.  at this stage, we are thinking of using accutane at that point. while i am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, i think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval.  in the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later.  i will look at this as a positive sign because i think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term. i will keep you apprised of followups.  if you have any questions or if i could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me. sincerely,     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     cc: headache. hx: 63 y/o rhf first seen by neurology on 9/14/71 for complaint of episodic vertigo. during that evaluation she described a several year history of &quot;migraine&quot; headaches. she experienced her first episode of vertigo in 1969. the vertigo (clockwise) typically began suddenly after lying down, and was not associated with nausea/vomiting/headache. the vertigo had not been consistently associated with positional change and could last hours to days. on 3/15/71, after 5 day bout of vertigo, right ear ache, and difficulty ambulating (secondary to the vertigo) she sought medical attention and underwent an audiogram which reportedly showed a 20% decline in low tone acuity ad. she complained of associated tinnitus which she described as a &quot;whistle.&quot; in addition, her symptoms appeared to worsen with changes in head position (i.e. looking up or down). the symptoms gradually resolved and she did well until 8/71 when she experienced a 19-day episode of vertigo, tinnitus and intermittent headaches. she was seen 9/14/71, in neurology, and admitted for evaluation. her neurologic exam at that time was unremarkable except for prominent bilateral systolic carotid bruits. cerebral angiogram revealed an inoperable 7 x 6cm avm in the right parietal region. the avm was primarily fed by the right mca. otolaryngologic evaluation concluded that she probably also suffered from meniere&#8217;s disease. on 10/14/74 she underwent a 21 day admission for sah secondary to right parietal avm. on 11/23/91 she was admitted for left sided weakness (lue &gt; lle), headache, and transient visual change. neurological exam confirmed left sided weakness, and dysesthesia of the lue only. brain ct confirmed a 3 x 4 cm left parietal hemorrhage. she underwent unsuccessful embolization. neuroradiology had planned to do 3 separate embolizations, but during the first, via the left mca, they were unable to cannulate many of the avm vessels and abandoned the procedure. she recovered with residual left hemisensory loss. in 12/92 she presented with an interventricular hemorrhage and was managed conservatively and refused any future neuroradiologic intervention. in 1/93 she reconsidered neurointerventional procedure and was scheduled for evaluation at the barrows neurological institute in phoenix, az.     <!-- 	neuro

~~~ -->     reason for consultation:  i was asked by dr. x to see the patient in regard to his likely recurrent brain tumor. history of present illness:  the patient was admitted for symptoms that sounded like postictal state.  he was initially taken to hospital.  ct showed edema and slight midline shift, and therefore he was transferred here.  he has been seen by hospitalists service.  he has not had a recurrent seizure.  electroencephalogram shows slowing.  mri of the brain shows large inhomogeneous infiltrating right frontotemporal neoplasm surrounding the right middle cerebral artery.  there is inhomogeneous uptake consistent with potential necrosis.  he also has had a spect image of his brain, consistent with neoplasm, suggesting relatively high-grade neoplasm.  the patient was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1999.  all details are still not available to us.  he underwent a biopsy by dr. y. one of the notes suggested that this was a glioma, likely an oligodendroglioma, pending a second opinion at clinic.  that is not available on the chart as i dictate. after discussion of treatment issues with radiation therapist and dr. z (medical oncologist), the decision was made to treat him primarily with radiation alone.  he tolerated that reasonably well.  his wife says it&#8217;s been several years since he had a scan.  his behavior had not been changed, until it changed as noted earlier in this summary. past medical history:  he has had a lumbar fusion.  i believe he&#8217;s had heart disease.  mental status changes are either due to the tumor or other psychiatric problems. social history:  he is living with his wife, next door to one of his children.  he has been disabled since 2001, due to the back problems. review of systems:  no headaches or vision issues.  ongoing heart problems, without complaints.  no weakness, numbness or tingling, except that related to his chronic neck pain.  no history of endocrine problems.  he has nocturia and urinary frequency. physical examination:  blood pressure 146/91, pulse 76.  normal conjunctivae.  ears, nose, throat normal.  neck is supple.  chest clear.  heart tones normal.  abdomen soft.  positive bowel sounds.  no hepatosplenomegaly.  no adenopathy in the neck, supraclavicular or axillary regions.  neurologically alert.  cranial nerves are intact.  strength is 5/5 throughout. laboratory work:  white blood count 10.4, hemoglobin 16, platelets not noted.  sodium 137, calcium 9.1. impression and plan:  likely recurrent low-grade tumor, possibly evolved to a higher grade, given the mri and spect findings.  dr. x&#8217;s note suggests discussing the situation in the tumor board on wednesday.  he is stable enough.  the pause in his care would not jeopardize his current status.  it would be helpful to get old films and pathology from abbott northwestern.  however, he likely will need a re-biopsy, as he is highly suspicious for recurrent tumor and radiation necrosis.  optimizing his treatment would probably be helped by knowing his current grade of tumor.     <!-- 	neuro

~~~ -->     reason for referral:  the patient was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x.  a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess neuropsychological factors, clarify areas of strength and weakness, and to assist in therapeutic program planning in light of episodes of syncope. brief summary &#038; impressions: relevant history:historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and an interview with the patient. the patient presented to dr. x on august 05, 2008 as she had been recently hospitalized for prolonged episodes of syncope.  she was referred to dr. x for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope.  the patient reports an extensive neurological history.  her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient.  in spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved &quot;honors in school&quot; and &quot;looked smart.&quot;  she reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age.  at 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus.  she reported that she will frequently &quot;bang her head against the wall&quot; to relieve the pain.  the patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age.  at 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches.  she reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and &quot;thrown two and a half city blocks.&quot;  the patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day.  she reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month.  her migraines became more severe following the head injury.  in 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights.  following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion.  these episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma. the patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep.  she reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused.  these episodes diminished from 2002 to june 2008.  when making dinner, she suddenly dropped and hit the back of her head on refrigerator.  she reported that she was unconscious for five to six minutes.  a second episode occurred on july 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day.  she was admitted to sinai hospital and assessed by a neurologist.  her eeg and head ct were considered to be completely normal.  she did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour eeg.  she reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized.  she stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and &quot;tunnel vision&quot; (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was &quot;spazzing out&quot; on the floor.  during these episodes, she reports that she cannot talk and has difficulty understanding. the patient also reports that she has experienced some insomnia since she was 6 years old.  she reported that she was a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of jack daniel.  she stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt.  in 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication.  at the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself.  the patient&#8217;s medical history is also significant for postpartum depression. the patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory.  she reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes.  she finds that she often has difficulty with expressing her thoughts, as she is very tangential.  she experiences episodes of not recalling what she was speaking of or remembering what activities she was trying to perform.  she reported that she had a photographic memory for directions.  she said that she experienced a great deal of emotional lability, but in general her personality has become more subdued.  at the present time, her daughter has now moved on to college.  the patient is living with her biological mother.  although she is going through divorce, she reported that it was not really stressful.  she reported that she spends her day driving other people around and trying to be helpful to them. at the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, the patient&#8217;s medication included ativan, imitrex, levoxyl, vitamin b12, albuterol metered dose inhaler as needed, and zofran as needed.  (it should be noted that the patient by the time of the feedback on september 19, 2008 had resumed taking her trileptal for bipolar disorder.).  the patient&#8217;s familial medical history is significant for alcohol abuse, diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. tests administered:clinical interviewcognistatmattis dementia rating scalewechsler adult intelligence scale &#8211;

visual-motor function:  on a visual spatial discrimination task, her performance fell solidly in the average range.  on a measure of fine motor manual dexterity, her right hand and left hand performance fell in the average range and when she was required to use both hands simultaneously, her performance decreased slightly into the low average range. learning &#038; memory skills:  on a five-trial 16-item verbal list learning measure, the patient&#8217;s rate of acquisition fell in the high average range.  when a interference list was introduced, she had some difficulty learning the interference list as she could only recall 25% of the words.  however, following the introduction of this list, she was still able to recall 15 of the 16 words from the original list.  following a 20-minute delay, she was able to recall 15 of the 16 words.  she entirely used a semantic cluster strategy.  overall, her performance fell in the high average range on this measure.  on a story (prose) verbal memory measure, her immediate and delayed (30 minute) recall both fell in the high average range. on the copy of the complex geometric design, her visual spatial organization was poor and her performance fell in the low average range.  her immediate recall of the design fell in the borderline range and following a 30-minute delay, she lost even more details to decline into the mildly impaired range.  in general, her copy of the design was notable for its lack of overall configuration and good stop.  her immediate recall failed to maintain a good stop overall configuration design and was void of details.  the design further decompensated after a 30-minute delay as she lost further configuration and details.  it is thought that her poor performance on this could represent some difficulty in visual memory, but most likely is due to poor initial encoding and organization of the design.  on facial recognition task, her immediate recognition of the faces fell in the high average range.  following a 30-minute delay, though her performance declined to the low end of average, this is a significant discrepancy and suggested that she did have difficulty retaining and retrieving the information that she had stored.  therefore, a subtle mild weakness is in visual spatial memory. academic function: behavioral/emotional function:  the patient was administered a mmpi-2.  her responses unfortunately were completely invalid due to an over endorsement of symptoms.  typically, an over endorsement of symptoms is indicative of significant affective distress or a need for attention.  on this measure, the patient reported an elevated level of affective distress and unusual ideation.  her profile is consistent with patients who may demonstrate their affective distress through physical means.  overall, this pattern should be interpreted very cautiously due to the invalid nature of the profile. summary &#038; impressions:  the patient was referred by neurologist for a neuropsychological evaluation for diagnostic clarity, and specific recommendations for medical and psychological intervention in light of undiagnosed episodes of syncope. in summary, the patient&#8217;s neuropsychological evaluation revealed selective deficits of executive system dysfunction, mild receptive language difficulties (partially due to executive system dysfunction) and subtle visual memory storage and retrieval superimposed upon an average level of intellect.  her mmpi-2 was invalid, but indicated that she was undergoing significant stress and that she is more likely to demonstrate her stress through physical and cognitive rather than emotional display. the patient&#8217;s neurobehavioral risk factors are significant for chronic history of migraines, bipolar disorder, depression, reported in utero exposure to alcohol, history of heavy substance abuse, and use of neuropsychiatric medication.  bipolar affective disorder is known to impact executive system dysfunction as patients have difficulty with impulsivity, cognitive flexibility, working memory, emotional control, and self-monitoring.  the patient&#8217;s performance is certainly consistent with this report.  medication can also have an effect on executive system functioning and attention/concentration.  despite this, it is far better for her to have access to neuropsychiatric medication to balance her mood swings.  there was some mild evidence of decreased visual spatial memory for retrieval in contrast to high average verbal memory.  although she had difficulty on measures of comprehension, it was likely due to decreased attention and concentration given that she was able to perform other tasks that require receptive language very well (verbal memory).  given the patient&#8217;s history, she has done extraordinarily well and many of her cognitive abilities are intact, which allow her to function at a very high level.  it is strongly recommended that she share these results with her psychiatrist/psychologist to assist in any treatment planning for her and to continue to make positive and achievable goals for the patient. you may wish to consider the following recommendations to improve the patient&#8217;s quality of life. recommendations:medical:1.  please share these results with dr. x to determine any need to change in her medical treatment.2.  it is critical that the patient take care of herself and reduce her distress.  in particular, she should make sure that she has a normalized sleeping pattern and she is eating appropriately and getting appropriate rest.psychological:1.  she should share these results with her psychiatrist/psychologist, to assess for any change in her current psychological treatment.2.  it is likely that the patient will need to stay on medication to treat her bipolar disorder.  bipolar disorder does not go into remission and sadly is a chronic disorder.3.  in psychotherapy, it is important for goals to be set for the patient and that she can achieve those goals.  it is apparent that she is frequently feeling overwhelmed and does not understand how to be able to take care of herself and ways that are not needing medical care.  goals to increase her sleep and reduce her stress may be fundamental, but are certainly required in her case. occupational:  the patient has many strong abilities and with balance of her emotional life, there is no reason why she cannot return to work.  her work setting should be in a well structured place with minimal multitasking and will keep a people contact.     <!-- 	neuro

~~~ -->     reason for visit:  the patient is an 84-year-old man who returns for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  he is accompanied by his wife and daughter. history of present illness:  i first saw him nearly a year ago on december 20, 2007.  at that time, he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight months.  this included severe cognitive impairment, gait impairment, and incontinence.  he had actually been evaluated at hospital with csf drainage via a temporary spinal catheter, but there was no response that was noted.  when i saw him, there were findings consistent with cervical stenosis and i ordered an mri scan of the cervical spine.  i subsequently referred him to dr. x, who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on july 16, 2008.  according to his notes this went well. according to the family, there has not been any improvement. with regard to the gait and balance, they actually think that he is worse now than he was a year ago.  he is virtually unable to walk at all.  he needs both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk.  therefore, he is always in the wheelchair. he is completely incontinent.  he never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom.  on the other hand when asked, he will indicate that he needs to go.  he wears a depends undergarment all the time. he has no headaches. his thinking and memory are worse.  for the most part, he is apathetic.  he does not talk very much.  he lives in a skilled nursing facility in the alzheimer&#8217;s section.  he does have some daytime activities.  he takes a nap once a day.  he does not read very much.  on the other hand, he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election.  he needs full assistance at the nursing home. medications:  from the list by the nursing home are aricept 10 mg in the evening, carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg three times a day, citalopram (celexa) 40 mg daily, colace 100 mg twice a day, finasteride (proscar) 5 mg once a day, flomax (tamsulosin) 0.4 mg once a day, multivitamin with iron once a day, omeprazole (prilosec) 20 mg once a day, senna 8.6 mg twice a day, tylenol 650 mg as needed, and promethazine 25 mg as needed. physical exam:  on examination today, this is a pleasant 81-year-old man who is brought back from the clinic waiting area in a wheelchair.  he is well developed, well nourished, and kempt. vital signs:  temperature 96.7, pulse 62, respirations 16, and blood pressure 123/71. head:  the head is normocephalic and atraumatic. mental status:  assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  the mini-mental state exam score was 14/30.  he was not at all oriented.  he did know we were at sinai hospital on the second floor.  he could spell &#8216;world&#8217; forward, but was mute when asked to spell backwards.  he was mute when asked to recall 3/3 objects for delayed recall.  he could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagons.  for comparison, the mini-mental state exam score last december was 20/30 when attention was tested by having him spell &#8216;world&#8217; backwards and 28/30 when tested with serial 7 subtractions.  additionally, there are times when he stutters or stammers.  i do not see any paraphasic errors.  there is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia.  he is also stimulus bound.  there is a tendency to mimic. cranial nerve exam:  there is no upgaze that i can elicit today.  the horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact.  this is a change from a year ago.  the muscles of facial expiration are intact as are hearing, head turning, cough, tongue, and palate movement. motor exam:  normal bulk and strength.  the tone is characterized by paratonia.  there is no atrophy, fasciculations, drift, or tremor. sensory exam:  intact to light touch. cerebellar exam:  intact for finger-to-nose testing that he can perform only by mimicking, but not by following verbal commands. gait:  severely impaired.  when in the wheelchair, he leans to one side.  he cannot getup on his own.  he needs assistance.  once up, he can bear weight, but cannot maintain his balance.  this would amount to a tinetti score of zero. review of x-rays:  i personally reviewed the ct scan of the brain from november 1, 2008 and compared it to the mri scan from a year ago.  the ventricles appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago.  the frontal horn span is now 6 cm, whereas previously it was about 5.5 cm.  the 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm.  there is no obvious atrophy, although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy.  the scan from a year ago showed that there was a patent sylvian aqueduct. assessment:  the patient has had worsening of his gait, his dementia, and his incontinence.  the new finding for me today is the limited upgaze.  this would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy, which was one of the differential diagnoses a year ago, or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventricles. problems/diagnoses:1.  question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).2.  possible supranuclear palsy.3.  severe gait impairment.4.  urinary urgency and incontinence.5.  dementia. plan:  i had a long talk with him and his family.  even though he has already had a trial of csf drainage via spinal catheter at hospital over a year ago, i offered this test to them again.  i do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricles on the scan.  his family and i discussed the facts that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus.  instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptoms that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference.  i have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed.  i gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives.  i specifically mentioned the 3% chance of infection, which mean a 97% chance of no infection.     <!-- 	neuro

~~~ -->     title of operation:  right-sided craniotomy for evacuation of a right frontal intracranial hemorrhage. indication for surgery:  the patient is very well known to our service.  in brief, the patient is status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor.  he was taken to the operating room for the orbitozygomatic approach.  intraoperatively, everything went well without any complications.  the brain at the end of the procedure was absolutely intact, but the patient developed a seizure in the intensive care unit and then was taken to the ct scan, developed a second seizure.  he was given ativan for this, and then began to identify a large component measuring about 3 x 3 cm of the right frontal lobe, what appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion of potential venous infarct.  i had a long discussion immediately with dr. x and dr. y.  we decided to take the patient immediately as a level 1 for evacuation of this hematoma with a small amount of a midline shift with an intraventricular component.  it worried me and i think that we needed to go ahead and take him to the operating room immediately.  the patient was taken as a level 1 immediately and emergently and into the operating room for this procedure.  the original plan was to do first a right-sided orbitozygomatic procedure and then stage it a few weeks later with an endonasal endoscopic procedure for resection of this pituitary tumor component.  he was taken to the operating room for evacuation of a right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma. preop diagnosis:  pituitary tumor with a large intracranial component, status post resection and now development of an intracranial hemorrhage. postop diagnosis:  intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with extension into the intraventricular space after resection of a pituitary tumor via orbitozygomatic approach. anesthesia:  general. procedure in detail:  the patient was taken to the operating room.  in the supine position, his head was put in a horseshoe without any complications.  the patient tolerated this very well, and the prior incision was immediately opened.  the surgery had taken place a few hours prior to this, the original orbitozygomatic approach.  at this point, this was a life-saving procedure.  we went ahead, opened the old incision after everything was sterilely prepped, and all the surgical instrumentation was brought into place.  we went ahead and opened the incision and took out the pterional bone flap without any complications.  we immediately opened the dura expeditiously, and the brain was moderately under some pressure, but not really bulging out.  so i went ahead and identified an area over the right frontal lobe that was a little bit consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct and nonviable tissue.  so we went ahead and did a corticectomy right there and identified the actual clot immediately and went ahead, and over the next few hours, very meticulously began to evacuate these clots without any complication whatsoever.  we went all the way down to the ventricle and identified this clot in the ventricle and went ahead and removed this clot without any complications, and we had a very nice resection.  the brain was very relaxed.  we had a very good resection of the actual blood clot, and the brain was very relaxed.  we irrigated thoroughly.  we identified the ventricles.  we went ahead and did a very careful hemostasis with avitene with thrombin and gelfoam with thrombin over the next times in doing the procedure.  all this was done very well, and then we lined the cavity with surgicel, and the surgicel was only put at the edge and draping down as to not to leave any fragments potentially to communicate with the actual ventricle, and then after this, everything was good.  we went ahead and closed back the actual dura back.  we had done a pericranial flap.  this was also put back in place and the dura was closed with 4-0 surgilons.  we reconstructed everything.  the frontal sinus was reconstructed thoroughly without any complications.  we went ahead and put once again a watertight closure and went ahead and put another piece of duragen with hemaseel in place, and went ahead and put the bone flap back and reconstructed very nicely once again with self-tapping, self-drilling screws, low-profile plates.  once everything was confirmed to be in place, we went ahead and closed the muscle flap and also the actual fat pad was put back into place and closed together with 0 pop-offs, and the skin with staples without any complications.  in summary, the procedure was going back to the operating room for evacuation of a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage, most likely a conversion of an intraparenchymal hematoma with extension into the ventricle without any complications.  so everything was stable.  estimated blood loss was about 100 cubic centimeters.  the sponges and needle counts were correct.  no specimens were sent to pathology. disposition:  the patient after this procedure was brought to the neuro intensive care unit for close observation.

~~~ -->     preoperative diagnoses:  multiple metastatic lesions to the brain, a subtentorial lesion on the left, greater than 3 cm, and an infratentorial lesion on the right, greater than 3 cm. postoperative diagnoses:  multiple metastatic lesions to the brain, a subtentorial lesion on the left, greater than 3 cm, and an infratentorial lesion on the right, greater than 3 cm. title of the operation:1.  biparietal craniotomy and excision of left parietooccipital metastasis from breast cancer.2.  insertion of left lateral ventriculostomy under stealth stereotactic guidance.3.  right suboccipital craniectomy and excision of tumor.4.  microtechniques for all the above.5.  stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound. indications:  the patient is a 48-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago.  a year ago, she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation.  she recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office, unable to ambulate in a wheelchair.  metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases, but no spinal cord compression.  she had a consult with radiation-oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery, but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed.  consequently, this operation is performed. procedure in detail:  the patient underwent a planning mri scan with stealth protocol.  she was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp.  general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  she was placed on the mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position.  she was well padded, secured, and so forth.  the neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions.  the posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with betadine soak scrub followed by betadine paint.  this was done only, of course, after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the stealth system.  sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed.  a biparietal incision was performed.  a linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation.  a biparietal craniotomy was carried out, carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the stealth stereotactic system.  the dura was opened and reflected back to the midline.  an inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor.  this was very delicate removing the tumor and the co-surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor.  the tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels.  at least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region.  bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally, however, was completely controlled.  complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound. once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained, this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area.  a linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve.  sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull.  a burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome.  a craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter.  it was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus.  stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum.  the ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor, and this was draining csf relieving pressure in the posterior fossa.  upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region, the brain was noted to be extremely tight, thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy. at the posterior fossa, a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly.  the tumor, as the one above, was removed, both piecemeal and with intraoperative cavitron ultrasonic aspirator.  a gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well. i then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the cp angle; however, this was just over the lower cranial nerves, and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss, this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter. meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well. the posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers.  the dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4-0 nurolon.  the dura was watertight, and it was covered with blue glue.  gelfoam was placed over the dural closure.  then, the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using #0 ethibond.  subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 and 0 vicryl, and the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon. for the cranial incision, the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound.  the bone flap was brought on to the field.  the dura was closed with running and interrupted 4-0 nurolon.  at the beginning of the case, dural tack-ups had been made and these were still in place.  the sinuses, both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus, were covered with thrombin-soaked gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses. once the dura was closed, the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the lorenz microplates.  the wound was then closed in layers.  the galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2-0 vicryl.  the skin was closed with a running locking 3-0 nylon. estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 l.  the patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 l of hespan and almost 3 l of crystalloid. nevertheless, her vitals remained stable throughout the case, and we hopefully helped her survival and her long-term neurologic status for this really nice lady.     <!-- 	neuro

~~~ -->     preoperative diagnosis:  metopic synostosis with trigonocephaly. postoperative diagnosis:  metopic synostosis with trigonocephaly. procedures:  1.  bilateral orbital frontal zygomatic craniotomy (skull base approach).2.  bilateral orbital advancement with (c-shaped osteotomies down to the inferior orbital rim) with bilateral orbital advancement with bone grafts.3.  bilateral forehead reconstruction with autologous graft.4.  advancement of the temporalis muscle bilaterally.5.  barrel-stave osteotomies of the parietal bones. anesthesia:  general. procedure:  after induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with a roll under his shoulders and his head resting on a foam doughnut.  scalp was clipped.  he was prepped with chloraprep.  incision was infiltrated with 0.5% xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 and he received antibiotics and he was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner. a bicoronal zigzag incision was made and raney clips used for hemostasis.  subcutaneous flaps were developed and reflected anteriorly and slightly posteriorly.  these were subgaleal flaps.  bipolar and bovie cautery were used for hemostasis.  the craniectomy was outlined with methylene blue.  the pericranium was incised exposing the bone along the outline of the craniotomy. paired bur holes were drilled anteriorly and posteriorly straddling the metopic suture.  one was just above the nasion and the other was near the bregma.  also bilateral pterional bur holes were drilled.  there was a little bit of bleeding from a tributary of the sagittal sinus anteriorly and so bone wax was used for hemostasis in all the bur holes. the dura was separated with a #4 penfield dissector and then the craniotomies were fashioned or cut.  i should say with the midas rex drill using the v5 bit and the footplate attachment, the bilateral craniotomies were cut and then the midline piece was elevated separately.  great care was taken when removing the bone from the midline.  bipolar cautery was used for bleeding points on the dura and especially over the sagittal sinus and the bleeding was controlled. the wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation. the next step was to perform the orbital osteotomies with careful protection of the orbital contents.  osteotomies were made with the midas rex drill using the v5 bit in the orbital roof bilaterally.  this was a very thick and vertically oriented orbital roof on each side.  midas rex drill and osteotomes and mallet were used to cut these osteotomies using retractors to protect the orbital contents and the dura.  the osteotomies were carried down through the tripod of the orbit and down through the lateral orbital rim and all the way down to the inferior orbital rim using the osteotome and mallet.  bone wax was used for hemostasis.  it was necessary to score the undersurface of the bone at the midline because it was so thick and pointed.  so we were not going to be able to effect the orbital advancement without scoring the bone and thinning it out a bit.  this was done with the midas rex drill using b5 bit.  also, the marked ridge just above the nasion was burred down with the midas rex drill.  the osteotomies were also carried down through the zygoma.  at this point, with a gentle rocking motion and sustained pressure using the osteotomes, it was then possible to carefully advance the orbital rims bilaterally, first on the right and then on the left again using just a careful rocking motion against the remaining bone to gently bend the orbital rims outward bilaterally. dr. x cut the bone grafts from the bone flaps and i fashioned a shelf to secure the bone graft by burring a ledge on the internal surface of the superior orbital rim.  this created a shelf for the notched bone graft to lean against basically anteriorly.  the posterior notch of the bone graft was able to be braced by the ledge of orbital roof posteriorly. the left medial orbital rim greenstick fractured a bit, but the bone graft appeared to stay in place. holes were then cut in the supraorbital rim for advancement of the temporalis muscle and then a synthes mesh was placed anteriorly using absorbable screw hardware and attached the mesh where the forehead bone flaps turned around and recontoured to make a nice bilateral forehead for isaac. at this point the undersurface of the temporalis muscle was scored using the bovie cautery to allow advancement of the muscle anteriorly and we sutured it to the supraorbital rims bilaterally with #3-0 vicryl suture.  this helped fill-in the indentation left by the orbital advancement at the temporal region. also, i separated the undersurface of the dura from the bone bilaterally and cut multiple barrel-stave osteotomies in the parietal bones and then greenstick fractured these barrel-staves outward to create a more normal contour of the bone slightly posteriorly. at this point, gelfoam had been used to protect the dura over the sagittal sinus during this part of the procedure. the wound was then irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  bleeding had been controlled during the procedure with bovie and bipolar electrocautery, even so the blood loss was fairly significant adding up to about 300 or 400 ml and he received that much in packed cells and he also received a unit of fresh frozen plasma. at this point, the reconstruction looked good.  the advancement was about 1 cm and we were pleased with the results.  the wound was irrigated and then the gelfoam over the midline dura was left in place and the galea was then closed with #4-0 and some #3-0 vicryl interrupted suture and #5-0 mild chromic on the skin.  the patient tolerated procedure well.  no complications.  sponge and needle counts

~~~ -->     procedures:1.  right frontal craniotomy with resection of right medial frontal brain tumor.2.  stereotactic image-guided neuronavigation for resection of tumor.3.  microdissection and micro-magnification for resection of brain tumor. anesthesia:  general via endotracheal tube. indications for the procedure:  the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of left-sided weakness and headaches.  she has a previous history of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, treated 2 years ago.  an mri was obtained which showed a large enhancing mass in the medial right frontal lobe consistent with a metastatic lesion or possible primary brain tumor.  after informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room for surgery. preoperative diagnoses:  medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift. postoperative diagnoses:  medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift, probable metastatic lung carcinoma. description of the procedure:  the patient was wheeled into the operating room and satisfactory general anesthesia was obtained via endotracheal tube.  she was positioned on the operating room table in the sugita frame with the head secured. using the preoperative image-guided mri, we carefully registered the fiducials and then obtained the stereotactic image-guided localization to guide us towards the tumor.  we marked external landmarks.  then we shaved the head over the right medial frontal area.  this area was then sterilely prepped and draped. evoked potential monitoring and sensory potentials were carried out throughout the case and no changes were noted. a horseshoe shaped flap was based on the right and then brought across to the midline.  this was opened and hemostasis obtained using raney clips.  the skin flap was retracted medially.  two burr holes were made and were carefully connected.  one was placed right over the sinus and we carefully then removed a rectangular shaped bone flap.  hemostasis was obtained.  using the neuronavigation, we identified where the tumor was.  the dura was then opened based on a horseshoe flap based on the medial sinus.  we retracted this medially and carefully identified the brain.  the brain surface was discolored and obviously irritated consistent with the tumor. we used the stereotactic neuronavigation to identify the tumor margins. then we used a bipolar to coagulate a thin layer of brain over the tumor.  subsequently, we entered the tumor.  the tumor itself was extremely hard.  specimens were taken and send for frozen section analysis, which showed probable metastatic carcinoma. we then carefully dissected around the tumor margins. using the microscope, we then brought microscopic magnification and dissection into the case.  we used paddies and carefully developed microdissection planes all around the margins of the tumor superiorly, medially, inferiorly, and laterally. then using the cavitron, we cored out the central part of the tumor.  then we collapsed the tumor on itself and removed it entirely.  in this fashion, microdissection and magnification resection of the tumor was carried out.  we resected the entire tumor.  neuronavigation was used to confirm that no further tumor residual was remained. hemostasis was obtained using bipolar coagulation and gelfoam.  we also lined the cavity with surgicel.  the cavity was nicely dry and excellent hemostasis was obtained. the dura was closed using multiple interrupted 4-0 nurolon sutures in a watertight fashion.  surgicel was placed over the dural closure.  the bone flap was repositioned and held in place using craniofix cranial fixators.  the galea was re-approximated and the skin was closed with staples.  the wound was dressed.  the patient was returned to the intensive care unit.  she was awake and moving extremities well.  no apparent complications were noted.  needle and sponge counts were listed as correct at the end of the procedure.  estimated intraoperative blood loss was approximately 150 ml and none was replaced.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     preoperative diagnosis:  brain tumors, multiple. postoperative diagnoses:  brain tumors multiple &#8211; adenocarcinoma and metastasis from breast. procedure:  occipital craniotomy, removal of large tumor using the inner hemispheric approach, stealth system operating microscope and cusa. procedure:  the patient was placed in the prone position after general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  the scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  the cusa was brought in to supplement the use of operating microscope as well as the stealth, which was used to localize the tumor.  following this, we then made a transverse linear incision, the scalp galea was reflected and the quadrilateral bone flap was removed after placing burr holes in the midline and over the parietal areas directly over the tumor.  the bone flap was elevated.  the ultrasound was then used.  the ultrasound showed the tumors directly i believe are in the interhemispheric fissure.  we noticed that the dura was quite tense despite that the patient had slight hyperventilation.  we gave 4 ounce of mannitol, the brain became more pulsatile.  we then used the stealth to perform a ventriculostomy.  once this was done, the brain began to pulsate nicely.  we then entered the interhemispheric space after we incised the dura in an inverted u fashion based on the superior side of the sinus.  after having done this we then used operating microscope and slight self-retaining retraction was used.  we obtained access to the tumor.  we biopsied this and submitted it.  this was returned as a malignant brain tumor &#8211; metastatic tumor, adenocarcinoma compatible with breast cancer. following this we then debulked this tumor using cusa and then removed it in total.  after gross total removal of this tumor, the irrigation was used to wash the tumor bed and a meticulous hemostasis was then obtained using bipolar cautery.  the next step was after removal of this tumor, closure of the wound, a large piece of duragen was placed over the dural defect and the bone flap was reapproximated and held secured with lorenz plates.  the tumors self extend into the ventricle and after we had removed the tumor, we could see our ventricular catheter in the occipital horn of the ventricle.  this being the case, we left this ventricular catheter in, brought it out through a separate incision and connected to sterile drainage.  the next step was to close the wound after reapproximating the bone flap.  the galea was closed with 2-0 vicryl and the skin was closed with interrupted 3-0 nylon sutures inverted with mattress sutures.  the sterile dressings were applied to the scalp.  the patient returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  hemodynamically remained stable throughout the operation. once again, we performed occipital craniotomy, total removal of her large metastatic tumor involving the parietal lobe using a biparietal craniotomy.  the tumor was removed using the combination of cusa, ultrasound, stealth guided-ventriculostomy and the patient will have a second operation today, we will perform a selective craniectomy to remove another large tumor in the posterior fossa.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     preoperative diagnosis:  left acoustic neuroma. postoperative diagnosis:  left acoustic neuroma. procedure performed:  left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma. anesthesia:  general. operative findings:  this patient had a 3-cm acoustic neuroma.  the tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve.  the facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections. procedure in detail:  following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery.  she was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with mayfield pins.  the left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion.  transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve emg monitoring were placed, and no response was verified.  the proposed incision was injected with 1% xylocaine with epinephrine.  next, t-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease.  the incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use. incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip.  periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone.  emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax.  bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure.  using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed.  the sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly.  from these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed.  bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in siloxane suspension for later use.  the bone flap was also left at the site for further use.  dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base.  bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus.  there was extensively aerated temporal bone.  at this point, dr. trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor.  the cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure.  once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone.  the dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone.  then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out.  the bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm.  there was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well.  the dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor.  the tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult.  therefore, dr. trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor.  with dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem.  the eighth nerve was identified and transected.  tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem.  the facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well.  it was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve.  attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed.  the superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus.  at this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct.  the tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated.  the tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor.  the nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face.  further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally.  however, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated.  however, the tumor was then thinned using cusa down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness.  it was released from the brainstem ventrally.  the tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery.  the facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes.  overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume.  at this point, dr. trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis.  the air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax.  a piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect.  next, the dura was closed with duragen and duraseal.  the bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect.  postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 vicryl sutures.  the skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 vicryl sutures.  running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels.  sterile mastoid dressing was then placed.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the pacu in a stable condition.  all counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure. estimated blood loss:  100 ml.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     preoperative diagnosis:  brain tumor left temporal lobe. postoperative diagnosis:  brain tumor left temporal lobe &#8211; glioblastoma multiforme. operative procedure:1.  left temporal craniotomy.2.  removal of brain tumor. operating microscope:  stealth. procedure:  the patient was placed in the supine position, shoulder roll, and the head was turned to the right side.  the entire left scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion after having being placed in 2-point skeletal fixation.  next, we made an inverted-u fashion base over the asterion over temporoparietal area of the skull.  a free flap was elevated after the scalp that was reflected using the burr hole and craniotome.  the bone flap was placed aside and soaked in the bacitracin solution. the dura was then opened in an inverted-u fashion.  using the stealth, we could see that this large cystic mass was just below the cortex in the white matter just anterior to the trigone of the ventricle.  we head through the vein of labbe, and we made great care to preserve this.  we saw where the tumor almost made to the surface.  here we made a small corticectomy using the stealth for guidance.  we left small corticectomy entered large cavity with approximately 15 cc of yellowish necrotic liquid.  this was submitted to pathology.  we biopsied this very abnormal tissue and submitted it to pathology.  they gave us a frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.  with the operating microscope and greenwood bipolar forceps, we then systematically debulked this tumor.  it was very vascular and we really continued to remove this tumor until all visible tumors was removed.  we appeared to get two gliotic planes circumferentially.  we could see it through the ventricle.  after removing all visible tumor grossly, we then irrigated this cavity multiple times and obtained meticulous hemostasis and then closed the dura primarily with 4-0 nurolon sutures with the piece of duragen placed over this in order to increase our chances for a good watertight seal.  the bone flap was then replaced and sutured with the lorenz titanium plate system.  the muscle fascia galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 vicryl sutures.  skin staples were used for skin closure.  the blood loss of the operation was about 200 cc.  there were no complications of the surgery per se.  the needle count, sponge count, and the cottonoid count were correct. comment:  operating microscope was quite helpful in this; as we could use the light as well as the magnification to help us delineate the brain tumor &#8211; gliotic interface and while it was vague at sometimes we could i think clearly get a good cleavage plane in most instances so that we got a gross total removal of this very large and necrotic-looking tumor of the brain.     <!-- 	neuro

~~~ -->     reason for referral:  the patient is a 76-year-old caucasian gentleman who works full-time as a tax attorney.  he was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia.  two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning. relevant background information:  historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  a summary of pertinent information is presented below.  please refer to the patient&#8217;s medical chart for a more complete history. history of presenting problem:  the patient was brought to the hospital emergency department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day.  he has no recollection of the event.  the following information is obtained from his medical record.  on 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times &quot;i do not feel well&quot; and looked &quot;glazed.&quot;  he does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  she thought he was warm and had chills.  he later returned to his baseline.  he was seen by dr. x in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  his neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the mini-mental status examination.  due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.  the patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours.  he was hospitalized at hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative eeg, mri showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous.  he was also reportedly amnestic for this episode. in 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an mri at that time which showed some small vessel changes. during this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline.  he thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age.  when i asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he &quot;felt fine the whole time.&quot;  he appeared to be somewhat questioning of the validity of reports that he was amnestic and confused at that time.  so, the patient reported some age related &quot;memory lapses&quot; such as going into a room and forgetting why, sometimes putting something down and forgetting where he had put it.  however, he reported that these were entirely within normal expectations and he denied any type of impairment in his ability to continue to work full-time as a tax attorney other than his wife and one coworker, he had not received any feedback from his children or friends of any problems.  he denied any missed appointments, any difficulty scheduling and maintaining appointments.  he does not have to recheck information for errors.  he is able to complete tasks in the same amount of time as he always has.  he reported that he has not made additional errors in tasks that he completed.  he said he does write everything down, but has always done things that way.  he reported that he works in a position that requires a high level of attentiveness and knowledge and that will become obvious very quickly if he was having difficulties or making mistakes.  he did report some age related changes in attention as well, although very mild and he thought these were normal and not more than he would expect for his age.  he remains completely independent in his adls.  he denied any difficulty with driving or maintaining any activities that he had always participated in.  he is also able to handle their finances.  he did report significant stress recently particularly in relation to his work environment. past medical history:  includes coronary artery disease, status post cabg in 1991, radical prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy for the same cancer, hypertension, lumbar surgery done twice previously, lumbar stenosis many years ago in the 1960s and 1970s, now followed by dr. y with another lumbar surgery scheduled to be done shortly after this evaluation, and hyperlipidemia.  note that due to back pain, he had been taking percocet daily prior to his hospitalization. current medications:  celebrex 200 mg, levothyroxine 0.025 mg, vytorin 10/40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, coreg 10 mg, glucosamine with chondroitin, prostate 2.2, aspirin 81 mg, and laxative stimulant or stool softener.  note that medical records say that he was supposed to be taking lipitor 40 mg, but it is not clear if he was doing so and also there was no specific reason found for why he was taking the levothyroxine. other medical history:  surgical history is significant for hernia repair in 2007 as well.  the patient reported drinking an occasional glass of wine approximately two days of the week.  he quit smoking cigarettes 25 to 30 years ago and he was diagnosed with cancer.  he denied any illicit drug use.  please add that his prostatectomy was done in 1993 and nephrectomy in 1983 for carcinoma.  he also had right carpal tunnel surgery in 2005 and has cholelithiasis.  upon discharge from the hospital, the patient&#8217;s sleep deprived eeg was recommended. mri completed on 09/30/09 showed &quot;mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with no significant interval change from a prior study dated june 15, 2007.  no evidence of acute intracranial processes identified.  ct scan was also unremarkable showing only mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.  eeg was negative.  deferential diagnosis was transient global amnesia versus possible seizure disorder.  note that he also reportedly has some hearing changes, but has not followed up with an evaluation for hearing aid. family medical history: reportedly significant for tias in his mother, although the patient did not report this during our evaluation and so that she had no memory problems or dementia when she passed away of old age at the age of 85.  in addition, his father had a history of heart disease and passed away at the age of 75.  he has one sister with diabetes and thought his mom might have had diabetes as well. social history:  the patient obtained a law degree from the university of baltimore.  he did not complete his undergraduate degree from the university of maryland because he was able to transfer his credits in order to attend law school at that time.  he reported that he did not obtain very good grades until he reached law school, at which point he graduated in the top 10 of his class and had no problem passing the bar.  he thought that effort and motivation were important to his success in his school and he had not felt very motivated previously.  he reported that he repeated math classes &quot;every year of school&quot; and attended summer school every year due to that.  he has worked as a tax attorney for the past 48 years and reported having a thriving practice with clients all across the country.  he served also in the u.s.  coast guard between 1951 and 1953.  he has been married for the past 36 years to his wife, linda, who is a homemaker.  they have four children and he reported having good relationship with them.  he described being very active.  he goes for dancing four to five times a week, swims daily, plays golf regularly and spends significant amounts of time socializing with friends. psychiatric history:  the patient denied any history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  he reported that some stressors occasionally contribute to mildly low mood at this time, but that these are transient. tasks administered:clinical interviewadult history questionnairewechsler test of adult reading (wtar)mini mental status exam (mmse)cognistat neurobehavioral cognitive status examinationrepeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status (rbans;

based on a word reading test, premorbid intellectual functioning was estimated to fall in the superior range.  he was notably impulse throughout the evaluation, as he would often try to begin a task before the examiner had completed providing instructions. cognitive functioning:  the patient was performed within the high average range on a measure of gross cognitive functioning assessing his performance across several domains including attention, visuospatial construction, memory conceptualization and initiation or perseveration.  he performed within normal limits on all these domains. attention:  passive and active auditory attention fell in the average range as he was able to accurately repeat six digits in forward sequence and five digits in backward sequence.  visual working memory was in the high average range.  on a test of sustained attention for visual stimuli, he demonstrated high rate of accuracy despite the fact that there was mild decreases in consistency of his responses as the task progressed and at different interstimulus intervals.  overall, however, these results appear to be well within normal limits.  thus taken together the patient&#8217;s auditory and nonverbal attentional abilities, all fell within normal limits and did not suggest significant decline from premorbid levels. language:  confrontation naming was strong and in the high average range.  he demonstrated good comprehension for verbal instructions.  he made a few very mild errors on a sentence repetition task, which may have been due to mild hearing problems.  the errors did not appear to be of clinical significance.  rapid verbal retrieval fell in the average range for both phonemic and semantic cues well within broad normal limits.  this result may have represented a mild weakness relative to his estimated premorbid functioning.  thus taken together, language abilities generally fell within the expected range, although mild weaknesses were seen in verbal fluency. visuospatial perception and construction:  visuospatial perception appeared to be within broad normal limits, although his construction and copy of visual figures was quite sloppy and imprecise. learning &#038; memory skills: verbal learning and memory:  on a contextual memory task (i.e. stories), the patient performed within the average range immediately following story presentation, as well as following a delay.  his recognition of story details was in the low average range.  when given a large amount of seemingly unorganized information (i.e.  16-item list), the patient&#8217;s initial ability to recall five-items immediately following presentation was in the average range.  he benefited significantly from repetition as he was able to recall 10 items following the second presentation and following a fifth presentation, he was able to successfully recall 13 of the 16 items (superior).  when immediately provided with a second list of 16-items, he was only able to recall three items immediately following presentation (low average).  his recall of the first list following short and long delays was in the average range.  delayed recognition was also average. of note, during his recalls, he made a large number of repetition errors suggesting some difficulty with self-monitoring of his responses.  he also did not recognize and apply any organizational strategy.  taken together, the patient&#8217;s performance across measures of verbal learning and memory fell within broad normal limits relative to others of same age.  however, given his very high level of premorbid functioning, his performance suggested some mild weaknesses in encoding and retrieval that he is generally able to overcome with repetition of information. he also appeared to have some difficulty organizing and monitoring his responses and difficulty with learning multiple simultaneous streams of information. non-verbal learning and memory:  the patient&#8217;s immediate recall of visual designs was in the borderline range.  however, he retained most of the information that he initially learned following a delay and his performance fell in the low average range.  recognition was average.  taken together, these results again suggest that he had difficulties with encoding and retrieval of nonverbal information.  however, he was able to retain most of the reduced amount of information that he had initially learned. executive functioning:  as mentioned, initiation and verbal fluency fell in the average range.  it is mildly weaker than expected given the patient&#8217;s strong premorbid functioning.  he was also noted to make a number of repetition errors on this task.  cognitive set shifting was generally within expected limits and in the average to high average range.  he was able to successfully inhibit a prepotent response.  on a task assessing cognitive flexibility inductive reasoning and the ability to use feedback in order to correct an ongoing response, the patient was noted to be quite impulsive and had difficulty conceptualizing alternate means to apply strategies in order to determine the correct answer and appeared to be somewhat distracted by nonessential information.  as mentioned above, he had a number of repetitions and difficulty organizing information meaningfully on memory tasks.  taken together, these results suggest mild weaknesses in aspects of frontal lobe functioning. motor functioning:  the patient performed in the average range with both of his right dominant hand and left nondominant hand on a speeded fine motor coordination task. emotional functioning:  on an affective screening measure, the patient endorsed only four items, which suggested that he was bothered by thoughts he could not get out of his head, often felt helpless, felt downhearted and blue and that his mind was not as clear as it used to be.  overall, these results fell within normal limits and suggest that he is not currently experiencing a clinical level of depressive symptoms. summary &#038; impressions:  the patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation due to possible changes in memory.  he has a history of two episodes of confusion and amnesia, the most recent of which occurred in september 2009 with differential diagnosis including seizure disorder versus transient global amnesia.  on this comprehensive evaluation, the patient demonstrated mild weaknesses relative to his very high level of premorbid functioning on tasks assessing memory and executive functioning.     <!-- 	neuro

~~~ -->     <strong>reason for referral:</strong> the patient is a 58-year-old african-american right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x. she is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the &#8220;early stages of a likely dementia&#8221; and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse. a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning. note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning. the patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results. <strong>relevant background information: </strong>historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient. a summary of pertinent information is presented below. please refer to the patient&#8217;s medical chart for a more complete history. <strong>history of presenting problem:</strong> the patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for hospital center for four years. she was dismissed from this position in september 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work. she continues to receive some compensation through fmla hours. she said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from state services. she said that these 90 days are up around the end of november. she said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints. she said that they began &#8220;as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor&#8217;s note for any days off. she said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays. she described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time. she said that since september 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback. in july of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time. following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, dr. y, ph.d. he completed a comprehensive independent medical evaluation on 08/14/2009. she said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore. please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence. the patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was &#8220;too derogatory.&#8221; a copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation. to summarize, the results indicated &#8220;diagnostically, the patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history. this suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.&#8221; it concluded that &#8220;results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathyâ€¦ the patient&#8217; deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing. the prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other. following her dismissal, the patient presented to her primary physician, henry fein, m.d., who referred her to dr. x for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits. his neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable. the patient scored 20/30 on the mini-mental status exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting. a repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure. <strong>imaging studies: </strong>mri of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions. note that the mri was done with and without gadolinium contrast. <strong>current functioning: </strong>the patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her. when asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills. she also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems. she continues to independently perform all activities of daily living. she is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning. she reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention. she said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician. she said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application. other current symptoms include excessive fatigue. she reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia. she also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year. she said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot &#8220;like dragging.&#8221; dr. x&#8217;s physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis. she said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body. muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip. <strong>other medical history: </strong>the patient reported that her birth and development were normal. she denied any significant medical conditions during childhood. as mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia. she also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm. mri of the c-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at c7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at c6-c7. mri of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon. as mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991. she thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control. she also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, gerd, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974. her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007. she has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night. she did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep. <strong>current medications:</strong> novolog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, topamax, lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin d, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin c. <strong>substance use: </strong>the patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs. she drinks two to four cups of coffee per day. <strong>social history: </strong>the patient was born and raised in north carolina. she was the sixth of nine siblings. her father was a chef. he completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes. her mother is 93 years old. her last job was as a janitor. she completed fourth grade. she reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time. family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression. the patient completed a bachelor of science in nursing through state university in 1979. she denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems. she was married for two years. her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse. she has two children ages 43 and 30. her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in new york. in school, the patient reported obtaining primarily a&#8217;s and b&#8217;s. she said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling. the patient worked for hospital center for four years. prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years. she was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that. prior to that, she worked for walter p. carter center reportedly for 21 years. she has also worked as an ob nurse in the past. she reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job. in her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women&#8217;s groups doing puzzles, playing computer games. <strong>psychiatric history: </strong>the patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue. she was also taking prozac during that time. she then began taking prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation. she reported a chronic history of mild sadness or depression, which was relatively stable. when asked about her current psychological experience, she said that she was somewhat sad, but not dwelling on things. she denied any history of suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation. <strong>tasks administered:</strong> clinical interview adult history questionnaire

the patient arrived unaccompanied and on time for her appointment. she ambulated independently and no gross psychomotor abnormalities were noted. vision and hearing appeared to be adequate for testing. she was neatly dressed and groomed. eye contact was good. she was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. speech was mildly slow and a few mild articulatory errors were noted near the end of the day, and a few paraphasic errors were noted on a confrontation naming task. there were otherwise no apparent problems with expression and speech was normal with respect to rhythm and prosody. she was somewhat quiet, but quite cooperative throughout the day. affect appeared to be mildly constricted, but she smiled and joked appropriately at times. mood appeared to be euthymic. receptive language abilities appeared to be within broad normal limits as she was able to appropriately respond to the examiner&#8217;s questions and instructions. thought processes were linear and goal-directed and no thought disturbances were noted. she appeared quite tired near the end of the day and it should be noted that sustained attention task was the last test that was given at the end of the day. when asked, the patient said that she recognized some of the tests that were given, but not most of them. she denied having look up any information on any of the tests that are typically involved in a neuropsychological battery or having any additional information about them since her last testing. overall, the patient appeared to put full effort into this evaluation. she was highly motivated and thus these results should be seen as an accurate reflection of her current cognitive functioning. note that there was some overlap in tests that were administered during this evaluation and those given at her evaluation in august of 2009. these include the ways for cpt ii, verbal fluency, and boston naming test, but this exception of the ways for most of these tests are not expected to have a significant practice effect associated with them; however, they will be interpreted with her recent evaluation in mind. <strong>evaluation findings:</strong> classification level |&#8211;|

|&#8212;&#8211;| &lt; 28 <strong>general cognitive ability: </strong>the patient performed in the high average range on a measure of gross cognitive functioning. her performances were within expected limits across subtests assessing attention, initiation, visuospatial construction, conceptualization, and memory. <strong>intellectual functioning: </strong>based on a word reading test, premorbid intellectual functioning was estimated to fall in the average range. current intellectual functioning fell in the average range (full scale iq equals 98, 45th percentile). her index scores also indicated average performance across tasks assessing the verbal knowledge and comprehension, visuospatial perception and reasoning, working memory (i.e. complex attention) and information processing. significant relative strengths were seen on tasks assessing stored verbal knowledge and nonverbal reasoning. significant relative weaknesses were seen on task assessing visuospatial perception and construction that included a time demand (low average). compared to her previous test results, the pattern of findings is quite similar with stronger performance on verbal relative to nonverbal tasks or those with significant working memory or speed demands. however, she performed somewhat better on most of these tasks in the current evaluation. to some degree this likely reflects measurement error and variability in addition to some practice effects, although some tests are less susceptible to such changes relative to others. <strong>academic achievement: </strong>the patient performed within the average range across tasks assessing word reading, sentence comprehension, and spelling skills. her previous evaluation referred to a number of misspellings that she had made on her list of medications and certain medical conditions and she made consistent errors again during this evaluation suggesting that she may simply have a weakness in this area. <strong>attention: </strong>auditory working memory was within the average range. visual working memory was low average. on a selective visual attention test, she demonstrated good accuracy in finding target stimuli while scanning information, although her overall speed was in the low average range. on a continuous performance test assessing sustained attention, she also demonstrated good accuracy, although it was noted that her response time tended to be slower when stimuli were presented with a longer interstimulus interval suggesting some difficulty adapting to changes in the temporal stimulus presentation. note that this latter performance is entirely consistent with her previous results and taken together these results suggest that attentional abilities were generally within expectations with some mildly weaker performance for complex visual relative to verbal information. there were inconsistencies noted in attentional abilities for both verbal and visual working memory. <strong>information processing speed: </strong>as noted, the patient had some difficulty adapting to changes in stimulus presentation speed on sustained attention task and there was some suggestion in her performances that she reduced her speed in order to increase accuracy; however, basic visual scanning and sequencing and psychomotor processing were in the average to high average range. <strong>language: </strong>mild articulatory and paraphasic errors were noted on a confrontation naming test. verbal retrieval for phonemic or category cues were in the high average and average range respectively. stored verbal knowledge was in the average range with as mentioned strengths noted in vocabulary. those language abilities were generally within expected limits. <strong>visuospatial perception and construction: </strong>the patient demonstrated variability in her performances on tasks assessing visuospatial perception and construction. basic visual perception assessed through her ability to accurately interpret angular line orientations was in the high average. mental organization and synthesis of parts of visual figures was in the average range on an untimed task that involved namable objects and in the low average range and relative weakness when it involved timed synthesis of shapes. visuospatial construction using either line drawings or blocks to match to a sample design was in the borderline to low average range. thus taken together, the patient demonstrated some relative weaknesses in aspects of visuospatial processing, particularly when tasks involved the time component or shapes and figures rather than recognizable objects. <strong>learning &amp; memory skills:</strong> <strong>verbal learning and memory:</strong> initial acquisition of a list of 15 unrelated items within the high average range (she successfully recalled eight items). she benefited significantly from repetition and demonstrated immediate and significant improvement in her recall, although across five learning trials, her learning curve was mildly inconsistent suggesting attentional weaknesses; however, following the fifth trial, her overall learning fell in the superior range (all 15 items were successfully recalled). spontaneous recall following a 20-minute delay was in the average range as she was able to remember 11 of the 15 items. she correctly recognized all those items during recognition (high average). taking together these memory results are well within expected limits. she demonstrated some mild forgetting, but still fell within the average range and was able to recognize items effectively suggesting mild weaknesses and inconsistencies with retrieval and attentional weaknesses may have contributed to variability in her learning curve initially. <strong>visual learning and memory: </strong>the patient&#8217; immediate recall of a complex figure was in the average range. she retained all of that information following a delay and her recall was in the high average range. recognition of the individual components of the figure was impaired. taken together these results highlight some difficulties with complex visuospatial perception and construction, although memory per se was intact based on her very strong recall performances. note also that she demonstrated this strong memory despite some initial errors in her copy of the complex figure itself again highlighting difficulties with perception and construction, but good overall memory functioning. <strong>executive functioning: </strong>as mentioned, working memory was stronger for verbal than visual information, but both were within broad normal limits. verbal fluency was within expected limits as well and she demonstrated particular strength in switching between semantic categories (very superior). design fluency was average. cognitive set shifting, inhibition of prepotent responses and planning and problem solving all fell within the average to high average range and within expected limits. abstract reasoning for visual and verbal information was also good. thus taken together, the patient did not demonstrate any difficulties with tasks assessing executive functioning. <strong>motor functioning:</strong> fine motor coordination skills were within the average range with both her right dominant hand and left hand. strength was impaired on both sides while basic motor speed was in the borderline range for both hands. these results are very similar to those that were found in her previous evaluation. they are consistent with decreased strength, but no loss of dexterity and they do not suggest any lateralized deficits. <strong>emotional functioning: </strong>on an affective screening measure, the patient endorsed only three items suggesting reduced energy and reduced clarity of thinking. overall, these results suggest that she is not experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms at this time. <strong>summary &amp; impressions: </strong>this is a 58-year-old african-american female with 16 years of education who is referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x in order to assess for possible cognitive impairment. she reported that she had recently been terminated from her position as a supervisory nurse in a psychiatric hospital following a neuropsychological evaluation that concluded that she may be in the &#8220;early stages of a likely dementia&#8221;. this evaluation was requested as a second opinion in order to clarify the nature of her cognitive impairment and make recommendations for ongoing treatment planning. overall, intellectual functioning fell in the average range on this evaluation. note that the same battery of tests was used in order to assess intellectual functioning and given the recency of her previous evaluation to some degree practice effects may have impacted her performance. however, we would not expect as significant of an impact upon tasks assessing processing speed and working memory. the same pattern of performance was noted across subtests in the intellectual battery with stronger performance on verbal knowledge based tasks relative to those assessing processing speed, working memory, and visuospatial skills. however, during this evaluation, she demonstrated significant improvement across tasks so that in general her profile is elevated, but the same profile pattern was seen. note that along with practice effects, performance can also be impacted by changes in attention, as well as measurement error. the possibility of attentional fluctuations having contributed to some of her performance is a definite possibility based on her performance on some attention tasks, which suggested that she at times performed better and was able to sequence in mind more information than she was able to passively repeat and she demonstrated inconsistencies in her learning curve on the memory task. our assessment of her intelligence as falling within the average range is consistent with our estimate of premorbid intellectual functioning and educational and occupational history. note that the ways for technical manual indicates that test retest gains are less pronounced for verbal comprehension and working memory subtests than perceptual reasoning and processing speed subtests and the patient&#8217; improvements were much higher than the mean increases in the normative sample that averaged a shorter period between testing and retesting. this suggests that as noted above other factors were applied, perhaps including attentional fluctuations. relative to intellectual functioning, the patient performed within expected limits across tasks assessing language functioning, verbal and visual memory, and executive skills and sustained attention. variability in performances was seen for information processing speed, particularly when responding to changes in the tempo of stimulus presentation or making more complex visual discriminations. immediate attention was also somewhat variable as she should be able to mentally manipulate greater amounts of visual and verbal material and she could just passively replicate. the better performance on raw scores on these more complex tasks is unusual and suggests fluctuations in attention for reasons other than brain base deficits. she also demonstrated weaker skills in complex visuospatial processing, particularly for shapes and figures rather than recognizable objects. of note, she performed poorly when these tasks involved the time component. meteorically, she demonstrated bilateral impairments in strength and motor speed, but dexterity and fine motor manipulation skills were within expected limits. the lack of lateralizing information and motor skills suggests that more peripheral factors and pain may have contributed to these results. taken together, these results do not necessarily suggest that there has been any significant decline from premorbid levels. it is possible that the patient has always had weaknesses in visuospatial processing and note that these weaknesses were not in basic visual skills and processing skills, but rather in putting together shapes and figures. the inconsistencies in her performances on processing speed and attention tasks suggest that while she may be somewhat slowed in completing tasks, there may be contributors other than brain base changes that impacted her results. in particular, the patient&#8217; current medications, as well as pain, fatigue, and medical conditions such as diabetes and associated possible neuropathy are likely important factors. results do not suggest the presence of a progressive dementing disorder. given the multiple factors that may have contributed to some of our findings, we do not believe that any cognitive disorder should be diagnosed at this time. if there are significant concerns about her cognitive functioning, it may be useful to make adjustments in her medication regimen. this is a not a work based evaluation and therefore questions regarding her ability to perform job duties will not be addressed. one concern that we would like to bring up is that if visuospatial problems are of newer onset, they may be contributing to her recent falls and thus should be monitored for changes and progression and she should return for reevaluation in one year&#8217;s time in order to determine any changes in her cognitive functioning. additional recommendations are provided below. note that there was a little overlap in tests given between the two testing sessions aside from the ways for cpt to word fluency. also note that she completed the brief self-report instrument and all of her results fell within normal limits. <strong>recommendations:</strong> 1. based on fluctuations in processing speed and attention, it is possible that the patient&#8217; current medications may be impacting her cognitive functioning to some degree. decisions regarding any changes are deferred to her physicians, but it may be useful to streamline her current medications while also continuing to effectively address symptoms. 2. the patient should return for reevaluation in one year&#8217;s time to monitor her cognitive functioning and evaluate for any improvements in performance following any medication changes. note also that stress related to her work situation and the nature of her previous neuropsychological evaluation may have also contributed to some of her difficulties on that testing. 3. the nature of her frequent falls is uncertain, but it is possible that weaknesses in visuospatial processing may be contributing and this should be further evaluated by her physicians.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     this is a 95.5-hour continuous video eeg monitoring study. technical summary:  the patient was recorded from 2:15 p.m. on 08/21/06 through 1:55 p.m. on 08/25/06.  the patient was recorded digitally using the 10-20 system of electrode placement.  additional temporal electrodes and single channels of eog and ekg were also recorded.  the patient&#8217;s medications valproic acid, zonegran, and keppra were weaned progressively throughout the study. the occipital dominant rhythm is 10 to 10.5 hz and well regulated.  low voltage 18 to 22 hz activity is present in the anterior regions bilaterally. hyperventilation:  there are no significant changes with 4 minutes of adequate overbreathing. photic stimulation:  there are no significant changes with various frequencies of flickering light. sleep:  there are no focal or lateralizing features and no abnormal waveforms. induced event:  on the final day of study, a placebo induction procedure was performed to induce a clinical event.  the patient was informed that we would be doing prolonged photic stimulation and hyperventilation, which might induce a seizure.  at 1:38 p.m., the patient was instructed to begin hyperventilation.  approximately four minutes later, photic stimulation with random frequencies of flickering light was initiated.  approximately 8 minutes into the procedure, the patient became unresponsive to verbal questioning.  approximately 1 minute later, she began to exhibit asynchronous shaking of her upper and lower extremities with her eyes closed.  she persisted with the shaking and some side-to-side movements of her head for approximately 1 minute before abruptly stopping.  approximately 30 seconds later, she became slowly responsive initially only uttering a few words and able to say her name.  when asked what had just occurred, she replied that she was asleep and did not remember any event.  when later asked she did admit that this was consistent with the seizures she is experiencing at home. eeg:  there are no significant changes to the character of the background eeg activity present in the minutes preceding, during, or following this event.  of note, while her eyes were closed and she was non-responsive, there is a well-regulated occipital dominant rhythm present. impression:  the findings of this patient&#8217;s 95.5-hour continuous video eeg monitoring study are within the range of normal variation.  no epileptiform activity is present.  one clinical event was induced with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  the clinical features of this event are described in the technical summary above.  there was no epileptiform activity associated with this event.  this finding is consistent with a non-epileptic pseudoseizure.     <!-- 	neuro

and in addition anti-purkinje cell and anti-neuronal antibodies (yo and ho) were not found; beta-2 microglobulin was 1.8 (normal); histoplasmosis ag negative. serum ace, spep, urine histoplasmin were negative. neuropsychologic assessment, 10/28/94, raised a question of a demential syndrome, but given her response style on the mmpi (marked defensiveness, with unwillingness to admit to even very common human faults) prevented such a diagnosis. severe defects in memory, fine motor skills, and constructional praxis were noted. chest-abdominal-pelvic ct scans were negative. 11/4/94 cerebral angiogram noted variable caliber in the rmca, laca and left aica distributions. it was intially thought that thismight be suggestive of a vasculopathy and she was treated with a short course of iv steroids. temporal artery biopsy was unremarkable. she underwent multiple mri brain scans at uihc: 11/4/94, 11/9/94, 11/16/94. all scans consistently showed increase in t2 signal in the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles and temporal lobes bilaterally. these areas did not enhance with gadolinium contrast. these findings were felt most suggestive of glioma. she underwent left temporal lobe brain biopsy on 11/10/94: this study was inconclusive and showed evidence of atypical mononuclear cells and lymphocytes in the perivascular and subarachnoid spaces. despite cytologic atypia the cells were felt to be reactive in nature, since immunohistochemical stains failed to disclose lymphoid clonality or non-leukocytic phenomena. little sign of vasculopathy or tumor was found. bacterial, fungal , hsv, cmv and afb cultures were negative. hsv, and vzv antigen was negative. her neurological state progressively worsened throughout her hospital stay. by time of discharge, 12/2/94, she was very somnolent and difficult to arouse and required ngt feeding and 24hour supportive care. she was made dnr after family request prior to transfer to a care facility.     <!-- 	neuro

~~~ -->     reason for consultation:  new-onset seizure. history of present illness:  the patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures.  although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  the typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  there have been no recent changes in her keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her. past medical history:  born at 36 weeks&#8217; gestation by c-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.  she does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue. past surgical history:  she has undergone no surgical procedures. family medical history:  there is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt.  there is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family. social history:  currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings.  she is at home full time and does not attend day care. review of systems:  clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness. physical examination:vital signs:  weight was 15.6 kg.  she was afebrile.  remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.general:  she was awake, alert, and oriented.  she was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the eeg leads.heent:  showed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear.  her eye movements were conjugate in nature.  her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.neck:  trachea appeared to be in the midline.chest:  clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.cardiovascular:  showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.abdomen:  showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  there was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.extremities:  showed iv placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the iv.  there was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  she had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.neurological:  from neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  her overall resting tone was normal.  sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  toes were downgoing bilaterally.  coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  gait examination was deferred at this time due to eeg lead placement. assessment:  a 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures. recommendations1.  for now, we will go ahead and try to capture eeg as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, i would defer the eeg until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.2.  as per the above, i will increase her keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  if further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 ml each day.3.  i do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her eeg findings.  eeg, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, i would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the eeg results.  the patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.4.  the patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks&#8217; time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     reason for consultation:  glioma. history of present illness:  the patient is a 71-year-old woman who was initially diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1982.  she underwent radiation therapy for this, although craniotomy was not successful for a biopsy because of seizure activity during the surgery.  she did well for the next 10 years or so, and developed parkinson disease, possibly related to radiation therapy.  she has been followed by neurology, dr. z, to treat seizure activity.  she has a vagal stimulator in place to help control her seizure activity. over the last few months, she has had increasing weakness on the right side.  she has been living in a nursing home.  she has not been able to walk, and she has not been able to write for the past three to four years. mri scan done on 11/13/2006 showed increase in size of the abdominal area and the left parietal region.  there was slight enhancement and appearance was consistent with a medium- to low-grade tumor anterior to the motor cortex. surgery was performed during this admission to remove some of the posterior part of the tumor.  she tolerated the procedure well.  she has noticed no worsening or improvement in her weakness.  pathology shows a low- to intermediate-grade glioma.  the second opinion by dr. a is still pending. the patient is feeling well today.  she is not having headache, and reports no new neurologic symptoms.  she has not had leg swelling, cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain. current medications:  1.  ambien p.r.n.  2.  vicodin p.r.n.  3.  actonel every sunday.  4.  colace.  5.  felbatol 1200 mg b.i.d.  6.  heparin injections for prophylaxis.  7.  maalox p.r.n.  8.  mirapex 0.5 mg t.i.d.  9.  protonix 40 mg daily.  10.  tylenol p.r.n.  11.  zanaflex 4-mg tablet, one-half tablet daily and 6 mg at bedtime.  12.  she has zofran p.r.n., albuterol inhaler q.i.d., and aggrenox, which she is to start. the rest of the history is mostly from the chart. allergies:  she is allergic to penicillin. past medical history:  1.  parkinson&#8217;s, likely secondary to radiation therapy.2.  history of prior stroke.3.  seizure disorder secondary to her brain tumor.4.  history of urinary incontinence.5.  she has had hip fractures x2, which have required surgical pinning.6.  appendectomy.7.  cholecystectomy. social history:  shows that she does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.  she lives in a nursing home. family history:  shows a family history of breast cancer. physical examination:  general:  today, she is sitting up in the chair, alert, and appropriate.  she tends to lean towards the right.  the right arm and hand are noticeably weaker than the left.  she is quite thin.vital signs:  temperature is 98.5, blood pressure is 138/75, pulse is 76, respirations are 16, and pulse oximetry is 92% on room air.heent:  there is a craniotomy incision on the left parietal region, clean, and dry with stitches still in place.  the oropharynx shows no thrush or mucositis.lungs:  clear bilaterally to auscultation.cardiac:  exam shows regular rate.abdomen:  soft.extremities:  no peripheral edema or evidence of deep venous thrombosis (dvt) is noted on the lower extremities. impression and plan:  progressive low-grade glioma, now more than 20 years since initially diagnosed.  she is status post craniotomy for debulking and has done well with the surgery. we reviewed the phase ii trials that have used temodar in the setting of grade 2 gliomas.  although, complete responses are rare, it is quite common to have partial response and/or stable disease, and most patients had improved quality of life indices including many patients who benefit from decreased seizure activity.  we discussed using temodar after she heals from her surgery.  toxicities would include fatigue, nausea, and myelosuppression primarily. the patient&#8217;s insurance is through securehorizons plan which we do not accept at our office, so i would discuss with dr. y setting her up to see another oncologist.  in the meantime, we can investigate the cost of temodar to her, i suspect she may have a 20% copay. she is anxious to have the foley catheter removed before she goes to her nursing home tomorrow.  she normally does not have a foley catheter in place.  orders have already been written by dr. y to have it removed.     <!-- 	neuro

however, for a long period time thereafter.  the patient then began having more tonic seizures after his episodic spasms had subsided, and failed several medication trials including valproic acid, topamax, and zonegran at least briefly.  upon starting lamictal, he began to have benefit and then actually had 1-year seizure freedom before having an isolated seizure or 2.  over the next 6 months to a year, he only had few further seizures, and was doing well in a general sense.  it was more recently that he began having new seizure events that have not responded to higher doses of lamictal up to 15 mg/kg/day.  these events manifest as tonic spells with eye deviation and posturing.  mother reports flexion of the upper extremities, extension with lower extremities.  during that time, he is not able to cry or say any sounds.  these events last from seconds to minutes, and occur at least multiple times per week.  there are times where he has none for a few days and other times where he has multiple days in a row with events.  he has another event manifesting as flexion of the upper extremities and extension lower extremities where he turns red and cries throughout.  he may vomit after these episodes, then seems to calm down.  it is unclear whether this is a seizure or whether the patient is still responsive. medications:  the patient&#8217;s medications include lamictal for a total of 200 mg twice a day.  it is a 150 mg tablet and 25 mg tablets.  he is on zonegran using 25 mg capsules 2 capsules twice daily, and baclofen 10 mg three times day.  he has other medications including the xopenex and atrovent. review of systems:  at this time is negative any fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal complaints, rashes, arthritis, or arthralgias.  no respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  he has no change in his skills at this point. family history:  noncontributory. physical examination:general:  the patient is a slender male who is microcephalic.  he has eeg electrodes in place and is on the video eeg at that time.heent:  his oropharynx shows no lesions.neck:  supple without adenopathy.chest:  clear to auscultation.cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs.abdomen:  benign with g-tube in place.extremities:  reveal no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.neurological:  the patient is alert and has bilateral esotropia.  he is able to fix and follow objects briefly.  he is unable to reach for objects.  he exhibits constant choreiform movements when excited.  these are more prominent in the upper extremities and lower extremities.  he has some dystonic posture with flexion of the wrist and fingers bilaterally.  he also has plantar flexion at the ankles bilaterally.  his cranial nerves reveal that his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  extraocular movements are intact other than bilateral esotropia.  his face moves symmetrically.  palate elevates in midline.  hearing appears intact bilaterally. motor exam reveals dystonic and variable tone, overall there is mild in spasticity both upper and lower extremities as described above.  he has clonus at the ankles bilaterally, and some valgus contracture of the ankles.  his sensation is intact to light touch bilaterally.  deep tendon reflexes are 2 to 3+ bilaterally. impression/plan:  this is a 9-year-old male with congenital brain malformation and intractable epilepsy.  he has microcephaly as well as dystonic cerebral palsy.  he had a re-emergence of seizures, which are difficult to classify, although some sound like tonic episodes and others are more concerning for non-epileptic phenomenon, such as discomfort.  he is admitted for video eeg to hopefully capture both of these episodes and further clarify the seizure type or types.  he will remain hospitalized for probably at least 48 hours to 72 hours.  he could be discharged sooner if multiple events are captured.  his medications, we will continue his current dose of zonegran and lamictal for now.  both of these medications are very long acting, discontinuing them while in the hospital may simply result in severe seizures after discharge.     <!-- 	neuro

~~~ -->     history of present illness:  the patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  i asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  he first mentioned that he has neck pain.  he states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  it is worse with movement.  it has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  it is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  he also endorses a history of gait instability.  this has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  he describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and &quot;walks like a duck.&quot;  he has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. he also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  when i asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  left is slightly more affected than the right.  he denies any tingling or paresthesias.  he also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  he thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  this has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  he has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  he also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  he does have a history of chronic low back pain. at the end of the visit, when i asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  he did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  when i asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  he basically lays in bed all day everyday.  i asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  he is unsure if this is optimally treated.  as i just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  he does not think that he is necessarily sad.  his appetite is good.  he has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. when i took his history, i noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  i asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at johns hopkins a couple of years ago.  he states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. when i asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw dr. x several years ago.  he believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  he told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after dr. y referred him for this evaluation.  he also saw dr. z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  he reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time. past medical history:  he has had diabetes for five years.  he also has had hypercholesterolemia.  he has had crohn&#8217;s disease for 25 or 30 years.  he has had a colostomy for four years.  he has arthritis, which is reportedly related to the crohn&#8217;s disease.  he has hypertension and coronary artery disease and is status post stent placement.  he has depression.  he had a kidney stone removed about 25 years ago. current medications:  he takes actos, ambien, baby aspirin, coreg, entocort, folic acid, flomax, iron, lexapro 20 mg q.h.s., lipitor, pentasa, plavix, protonix, toprol, celebrex and zetia. allergies:  he states that imuran caused him to develop tachycardia. social history:  he previously worked with pipeline work, but has been on disability for five years.  he is unsure which symptoms led him to go on disability.  he has previously smoked about two packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years, but quit about 20 years ago.  he denies alcohol or illicit drug use.  he lives with his wife.  he does not really have any hobbies. family history:  his father died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 49.  his mother died in her 70s from complications of congestive heart failure.  he has one sister who died during a cardiac surgery two years ago.  he has another sister with diabetes.  he has one daughter with hypercholesterolemia.  he is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders. review of systems:  he has dyspnea on exertion.  he states that he was evaluated by a pulmonologist and had a normal evaluation.  he has occasional night sweats.  his hearing is poor.  he occasionally develops bloody stools, which he attributes to his crohn&#8217;s disease.  he also was diagnosed with sleep apnea.  he does not wear his cpap machine on a regular basis.  he has a history of anemia.  otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  this is documented in the handwritten notes from today&#8217;s visit. physical examination:vital signs:  blood pressure 160/86 hr 100 rr 16 wt 211 pounds pain 3/10general appearance:  he is well appearing in no acute distress.  he has somewhat of a flat affect.cardiovascular:  he has a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  there are no carotid bruits.chest:  the lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.skin:  there are no rashes or lesions.musculoskeletal:  he has no joint deformities or scoliosis. neurological examination:mental status:  his speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia.  he is alert and oriented to name, place, and date.  attention, concentration, and fund of knowledge are intact.  he has 3/3 object registration and 1/3 recall in 5 minutes. cranial nerves:  pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  visual fields are full.  optic discs are normal.  extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus.  facial sensation is normal.  there is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness.  hearing is grossly intact.  shoulder shrug is full. motor:  he has normal muscle bulk and tone.  there is no atrophy.  he has few fasciculations in his calf muscles bilaterally.  manual muscle testing reveals mrc grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.  there is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. sensory:  he has absent vibratory sensation at the left toe.  this is diminished at the right toe.  joint position sense is intact.  there is diminished sensation to light touch and temperature at the feet to the knees bilaterally.  pinprick is intact.  romberg is absent.  there is no spinal sensory level. coordination:  this is intact by finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.  he does have a slight tremor of the head and outstretched arms. deep tendon reflexes:  they are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas, and ankles.  plantar reflexes are flexor.  there is no ankle clonus, finger flexors, or hoffman&#8217;s signs.  he has crossed adductors bilaterally. gait and stance:  he has a slightly wide-based gait.  he has some difficulty with toe walking, but he is able to walk on his heels and tandem walk.  he has difficulty with toe raises on the left. radiologic data:  mri of the cervical spine, 09/30/08:  chronic spondylosis at c5-c6 causing severe bilateral neuroforamining and borderline-to-mold cord compression with normal cord signal.  spondylosis of c6-c7 causing mild bilateral neuroforamining and left paracentral disc herniation causing borderline cord compression. thoracic mri spine without contrast:  minor degenerative changes without stenosis. i do not have the mri of the lumbar spine available to review. laboratory data:  10/07/08:  vitamin b1 210 (87-280), vitamin b6 6, esr 6, ast 25, alt 17, vitamin b12 905, cpk 226 (0-200), t4 0.85, tsh 3.94, magnesium 1.7, rpr nonreactive, crp 4, lyme antibody negative, spep abnormal (serum protein electrophoresis), but no paraprotein by manifestation, hemoglobin a1c 6.0, aldolase 3.9 and homocystine 9.0. assessment:  the patient is a 63-year-old gentleman with multiple neurologic and nonneurologic symptoms including numbness, gait instability, decreased dexterity of his arms and general fatigue.  his neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.  he has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks. i think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial.  he probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy, but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy.  he really is most concerned about the fatigue and i think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea.  whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen. recommendations:1.  i scheduled him for repeat emg and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy.2.  i will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although i am confident in dr. z&#8217;s opinion that there is no surgical indication.3.  i gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain.4.  i believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression.  it may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications, but i will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist.  the patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion.5.  he does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled.  he states that he is not compliant because the face mask that he uses does not fit him well.  this should also be addressed.6.  i also am checking another cpk to see if there is any elevation.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     diagnoses:1.  juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.2.  recent generalized tonic-clonic seizure. medications:1.  lamictal 250 mg b.i.d.2.  depo-provera. interim history:  the patient returns for followup.  since last consultation she has tolerated lamictal well, but she has had a recurrence of her myoclonic jerking.  she has not had a generalized seizure.  she is very concerned that this will occur.  most of the myoclonus is in the mornings.  recent eeg did show polyspike and slow wave complexes bilaterally, more prominent on the left.  she states that she has been very compliant with the medications and is getting a good amount of sleep.  she continues to drive. social history and review of systems are discussed above and documented on the chart. physical examination:  vital signs are normal.  pupils are equal and reactive to light.  extraocular movements are intact.  there is no nystagmus.  visual fields are full.  demeanor is normal.  facial sensation and symmetry is normal.  no myoclonic jerks noted during this examination.  no myoclonic jerks provoked by tapping on her upper extremity muscles.  negative orbit.  deep tendon reflexes are 2 and symmetric.  gait is normal.  tandem gait is normal.  romberg negative. impression and plan:  recurrence of early morning myoclonus despite high levels of lamictal.  she is tolerating the medication well and has not had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  she is concerned that this is a precursor for another generalized seizure.  she states that she is compliant with her medications and has had a normal sleep-wake cycle. looking back through her notes, she initially responded very well to keppra, but did have a breakthrough seizure on keppra.  this was thought secondary to severe insomnia when her baby was very young.  because she tolerated the medication well and it was at least partially affective, i have recommended adding keppra 500 mg b.i.d.  side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient. i will see in followup in three months.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     reason for visit:  the patient is an 11-month-old with a diagnosis of stage 2 neuroblastoma here for ongoing management of his disease and the visit is supervised by dr. x. history of present illness:  the patient is an 11-month-old with neuroblastoma, which initially presented on the left when he was 6 weeks old and was completely resected.  it was felt to be stage 2.  it was not n-myc amplified and had favorable shimada histology.  in followup, he was found to have a second primary in his right adrenal gland, which was biopsied and also consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable shimada histology.  he is now being treated with chemotherapy per protocol p9641 and not on study.  he last received chemotherapy on 05/21/07, with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.  he received g-csf daily after his chemotherapy due to neutropenia that delayed his second cycle.  in the interval since he was last seen, his mother reports that he had a couple of days of nasal congestion, but it is now improving.  he is not acted ill or had any fevers.  he has had somewhat diminished appetite, but it seems to be improving now.  he is peeing and pooping normally and has not had any diarrhea.  he did not have any appreciated nausea or vomiting.  he has been restarted on fluconazole due to having redeveloped thrush recently. review of systems:  the following

10.9, and platelets 202,000 with anc 2974.  medical tests none.  radiologic studies are none. assessment:  this patient&#8217;s disease is life threatening, currently causing moderately severe side effects. problems diagnoses:  1.  neuroblastoma of the right adrenal gland with favorable shimada histology.2.  history of stage 2 left adrenal neuroblastoma, status post gross total resection.3.  immunosuppression.4.  mucosal candidiasis.5.  resolving neutropenia. procedures and immunizations:  none. plans:  1.  neuroblastoma.  the patient will return to the pediatric oncology clinic on 06/13/07 to 06/15/07 for his third cycle of chemotherapy.  i will plan for restaging with ct of the abdomen prior to the cycle.2.  immunosuppression.  the patient will continue on his bactrim twice a day on thursday, friday, and saturday.  additionally, we will tentatively plan to have him continue fluconazole since this is his second episode of thrush.3.  mucosal candidiasis.  we will continue fluconazole for thrush.  i am pleased that the clinical evidence of disease appears to have resolved.  for resolving neutropenia, i advised gregory&#8217;s mother about it is okay to discontinue the g-csf at this time.  we will plan for him to resume g-csf after his next chemotherapy and prescription has been sent to the patient&#8217;s pharmacy. pediatric oncology attending:  i have reviewed the history of the patient.  this is an 11-month-old with neuroblastoma who received chemotherapy with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin on 05/21/07 for cycle 2 of pog-9641 due to his prior history of neutropenia, he has been on g-csf.  his anc is nicely recovered.  he will have a restaging ct prior to his next cycle of chemotherapy and then return for cycle 3 chemotherapy on 06/13/07 to 06/15/07.  he continues on fluconazole for recent history of thrush.  plans are otherwise documented above.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     reason for consultation:  neurologic consultation was requested by dr. x to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy. history of present illness:  the patient is well known to me.  she has symptomatic partial epilepsy secondary to a static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and shunted hydrocephalus related to prematurity.  she also has a history of factor v leiden deficiency.  she was last seen at neurology clinic on 11/16/2007.  at that time, instructions were given to mom to maximize her trileptal dose if seizures continue.  she did well on 2 ml twice a day without any sedation.  this past friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly.  this consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing.  diastat was used and which mom perceived was effective.  her trileptal dose was increased to 3 ml b.i.d. yesterday. according to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she has been sleepier than normal.  she appeared to be stable until this past monday about six days ago, she became more lethargic and had episodes of vomiting and low-grade fevers.  according to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization.  reportedly, she was given a medication in the emergency room.  she still is lethargic, will not wake up spontaneously.  when she does awaken however, she is appropriate, and interacts with them.  she is able to eat well; however her overall p.o. intake has been diminished.  she has also been less feisty as her usual sounds.  she has been seizure free since her admission. laboratory data:  pertinent labs obtained here showed the following:  crp is less than 0.3, cmp normal, and cbc within normal limits.  csf cultures so far is negative.  dr. limon&#8217;s note refers to a csf, white blood cell count of 2, 1 rbc, glucose of 55, and protein of 64.  there are no imaging studies in the computer.  i believe that this may have been done at kaweah delta hospital and reviewed by dr. x, who indicated that there was no evidence of shunt malfunction or infection. current medications:  trileptal 180 mg b.i.d., lorazepam 1 mg p.r.n., acetaminophen, and azithromycin. physical examination:general:  the patient was asleep, but easily aroused.  there was a brief period of drowsiness, which she had some jerky limb movements, but not seizures.  she eventually started crying and became agitated.  she made attempts to sit by bending her neck forward.  fully awake, she sucks her bottle eagerly.heent:  she was obviously visually impaired.  pupils were 3 mm, sluggishly reactive to light.extremities:  bilateral lower extremity spasticity was noted.  there was increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity.  iv was noted on the left hand. assessment:  seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness.  her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her trileptal dose was increased yesterday and these are probable explanations if indeed shunt malfunction has been excluded. i concur with dr. x&#8217;s recommendations.  i do not recommend any changes in trileptal for now.  i will be available while she remains hospitalized.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     eeg during wakefulness demonstrates background activity consisting of beta rhythms in the 12- to 14-hz range.  some ekg artifact is noted intermittently.  the background activity appears to be bilaterally symmetric and consistent throughout.  the recording time is 22 minutes and 57 seconds.  there is some attenuation of the background activity during drowsiness.  some late sleep is recorded.  photic stimulation induced no abnormal changes in the record.  no paroxysmal or focal abnormalities are seen in this recording. impression:  eeg during wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep with synchronous video monitoring demonstrated no evidence of focal or epileptogenic activity.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     i had the pleasure of seeing mr. abc in neurologic consultation and follow-up on mm/dd/yyyy.  mr. abc reports that he has had several issues in the family.  one of them is that his grandmother passed.  in addition, the family dog fell ill.  this has led to distress.  he reports better controlled pain.  mr. abc reports, otherwise, intermittent adherence to copaxone.  he had in the past been on interferon, but did not tolerate the medication, because of side effects.  his sleep/wake cycle remains very erratic. social history, family history, and past medical history: reviewed.  there are no changes, otherwise. review of systems:  fatigue, pain, difficulty with sleep, mood fluctuations, low stamina, mild urgency frequency and hesitancy, preponderance of lack of stamina, preponderance of pain particularly in the left shoulder. examination:  the patient is alert and oriented.  extraocular movements are full.  the face is symmetric.  the uvula is midline.  speech has normal prosody.  today there is much less guarding of the left shoulder.  in the lower extremities, iliopsoas, quadriceps, femoris and tibialis anterior are full.  the gait is narrow based and noncircumductive.  rapid alternating movements are slightly off bilaterally.  the gait does not have significant slapping characteristics.  sensory examination is largely unremarkable.  heart, lungs, and abdomen are within normal limits. impression:  mr. abc is doing about the same.  we discussed the issue of adherence to copaxone.  in order to facilitate this, i would like him to take copaxone every other day, but on a regular rhythm.  his wife continues to inject him.  he has not been able to start himself on the injections. greater than 50% of this 40-minute appointment was devoted to counseling.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     reason for visit:  the patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by dr. x.  the patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter.  he provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it. history of present illness:  he has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.  when i asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder.  he is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory. according to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  at first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself.  they did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  as time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  he started to shuffle.  he started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since july of 2006.  at this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat.  he frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking.  he has not fallen in the last month.  he did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall.  his family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  he has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  his handwriting has become smaller and shakier. in regard to the bladder, he states, &quot;i wet the bed.&quot;  in talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder.  he was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  this was treated by dr. y.  dr. x does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient&#8217;s urinary incontinence.  the patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  his wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.  he has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped. he has no headaches or sensation of head fullness. in regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  his wife took over his medications about two years ago.  she stopped his driving about three years ago.  she discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  apparently, he did not object.  at this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home.  he needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  he is a retired office machine repairman.  he is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day. he has not had pt or ot and has not been treated with medications for parkinson&#8217;s disease or alzheimer&#8217;s disease.  he has been treated for the bladder.  he has not had lumbar puncture. past medical history and review of all 14 systems from the form they completed for this visit that i reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he has had hypertension since 1985, hypercholesterolemia since 1997, and diabetes since 1998.  the bladder tumor was discovered in 2005 and was treated noninvasively.  he has lost weight from about 200 pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years.  he had a period of depression in 1999 and was on prozac for a while, but this was then stopped.  he used to drink a significant amount of alcohol.  this was problematic enough that his wife was concerned.  she states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day. social history:  he quit smoking in 1968.  his current weight is 183 pounds.  his tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches. family history:  his grandfather had arthritis.  his father had parkinson&#8217;s disease.  his mother had heart disease and a sister has diabetes. he does not have a living will and indicates he would wish his wife to make decisions for him if he could not make them for himself. review of hydrocephalus risk factors:  none. allergies:  none. medications:  metformin 500 mg three times a day, lipitor 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg per day, uroxatral 10 mg per day, detrol la 4 mg per day, and aspirin 81 mg per day. physical exam:  on examination today, this is a pleasant 76-year-old man who is guided back from the clinic waiting area walking with his walker.  he is well developed, well nourished, and kempt. vital signs:  his weight is 180 pounds. head:  the head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  the head circumference is 59 cm, which is the 75-90th percentile for an adult man whose height is 178 cm. spine:  the spine is straight and not tender.  i can easily palpate the spinous processes.  there is no scoliosis. skin:  no neurocutaneous stigmata. cardiovascular examination:  no carotid or vertebral bruits. mental status:  assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  the mini-mental state exam score was 17/30.  he did not know the year, season, or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor.  there was a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation.  he could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons. cranial nerve exam:  no evidence of papilledema.  the pupillary light reflex is intact as are extraocular movements without nystagmus, facial expression and sensation, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement. motor exam:  normal bulk and strength, but the tone is marked by significant paratonia.  there is no atrophy, fasciculations, or drift.  there is tremulousness of the outstretched hands. sensory exam:  is difficult to interpret.  either he does not understand the test or he is mostly guessing. cerebellar exam:  is intact for finger-to-nose, heel-to-knee, and rapid alternating movement tests.  there is no dysarthria. reflexes:  trace in the arms, 2+ at the knees, and 0 at the ankles.  it is not certain whether there is a babinski sign or simply withdrawal. gait:  assessed using the tinetti assessment tool that shows a balance score of 7-10/16 and a gait score of 2-5/12 for a total score of 9-15/28, which is significantly impaired. review of x-rays:  i personally reviewed the mri scan of the brain from december 11, 2007 at advanced radiology.  it shows the ventricles are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm.  the 3rd ventricle contour is flat.  the span is enlarged at 12 mm.  the sylvian aqueduct is patent.  there is a pulsation artifact.  the corpus callosum is effaced.  there are extensive t2 signal abnormalities that are confluent in the corona radiata.  there are also scattered t2 abnormalities in the basal ganglia.  there is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy.  there is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy. assessment:  the patient has a clinical syndrome that raises the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  his examination today is notable for moderate-to-severe dementia and moderate-to-severe gait impairment.  his mri scan raises the question of hydrocephalus, however, is also consistent with cerebral small vessel disease. problems/diagnoses:1.  possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).2.  probable cerebral small-vessel disease (290.40 &#038; 438).3.  gait impairment (781.2).4.  urinary urgency and incontinence (788.33).5.  dementia.6.  hypertension.7.  hypercholesterolemia.8.  diabetes. plan:  i had a long conversation with him and his family.  i explained how the symptoms raise the question of hydrocephalus, but are not specific.  i also explained how the appearance of the ventricles on the mri scan raise the question of hydrocephalus, but are not specific for.  i also described the evidence on the mri scan of the long-term effects of his vascular risk factors and explained to his family that these can cause a clinical syndrome that is virtually identical to hydrocephalus.  i explained that it is possible for patients to have both and the best way to determine whether he has hydrocephalus, and more specifically whether he would benefit from shunt surgery is to undertake a test with temporary removal of spinal fluid.  i reviewed both our outpatient lumbar puncture approach and our inpatient spinal catheter protocol.  i gave them a printed description of the inpatient spinal catheter protocol.  his daughter tape-recorded our discussions, so that they can review this. we did review the specific risk of 2% to 3% chance of infection associated with the spinal catheter

~~~ -->     history:  neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with her seizure medication.  the patient is a 3-year 3 months old girl with refractory epilepsy.  she had been previously followed by xyz, but has been under the care of the ucsf epilepsy program and recently by dr. y.  i reviewed her pertinent previous neurology evaluations at chcc and also interviewed mom. the patient had seizure breakthrough in august 2007, which requires inpatient admission, thanksgiving and then after that time had seizures every other day, up-to-date early december.  she remained seizure-free until 12/25/2007 when she had a breakthrough seizure at home treated with diastat.  she presented to our er today with prolonged convulsive seizure despite receiving 20 mg of diastat at home.  mom documented 103 temperature at home.  in the er, this was 101 to 102 degrees fahrenheit.  i reviewed the er notes.  at 0754 hours, she was having intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures despite receiving a total of 1.5 mg of lorazepam x5.  ucsf fellow was contacted.  she was given additional fosphenytoin and had a total dose of 15 mg/kg administered.  vital weight was 27.  seizures apparently had stopped.  the valproic acid level obtained at 0835 hours was 79.  according to mom, her last dose was at 6 p.m. and she did not receive her morning dose.  other labs slightly showed leukocytosis with white blood cell count 21,000 and normal cmp. previous workup here showed an eeg on 2005, which showed a left posterior focus.  mri on june 2007 and january 2005 were within normal limits.  mom describes the following seizure types:1.  eye blinking with unresponsiveness.2.  staring off to one side.3.  focal motor activity in one arm and recently generalized tonic seizure. she also said that she was supposed to see dr. y this friday, but had postponed it to some subsequent time when results of genetic testing would be available.  she was being to physicians&#8217; care as dr. z had previously being following her last ucsf. she had failed most of the first and second line anti-epileptic drugs.  these include keppra, lamictal, trileptal, phenytoin and phenobarbital.  these are elicited to allergies, but she has not had any true allergic reactions to these.  actually, it has resulted in an allergic reaction resulting in rash and hypotension. she also had been treated with clobazam.  her best control is with her current regimen of valproic acid and tranxene.  other attempts to taper topamax, but this resulted increased seizures.  she also has oligohidrosis during this summertime. current medications:  include diastat 20 mg; topamax 25 mg b.i.d., which is 3.3 per kilo per day; tranxene 15 mg b.i.d.; depakote 125 mg t.i.d., which is 25 per kilo per day. physical examination:vital signs:  weight 15 kg.general:  the patient was awake, she appeared sedated and postictal.neck:  supple.neurological:  she had a few brief myoclonic jerks of her legs during drowsiness, but otherwise no overt seizure, no seizure activity nor involuntary movements were observed. she was able to follow commands such as when i request that she gave mom a kiss.  she acknowledged her doll.  left fundus is sharp.  she resisted the rest of the exam.  there was no obvious lateralized findings. assessment:  status epilepticus resolved.  triggered by a febrile illness, possibly viral.  refractory remote symptomatic partial epilepsy. impression:  i discussed the maximizing depakote to mom and she concurred.  i recommend increasing her maintenance dose to one in the morning, one in the day, and two at bedtime.  for today, she did give an iv depacon 250 mg and the above dosage can be continued iv until she is taking p.o.  dr. x agreed with the changes and orders were written for this.  she can continue her current doses of topamax and tranxene.  this can be given by ng if needed.  topamax can be potentially increased to 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night.  i will be available as needed during the rest of her hospitalization.  mom will call contact dr. y an update him about the recent changes.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     reason for neurological consultation:  muscle twitching, clumsiness, progressive pain syndrome, and gait disturbance. history of present illness:  the patient is a 62-year-old african-american male with a significant past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual right-sided weakness as well as two mis, status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001.  he states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands.  more recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness.  this has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.  over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands.  he denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation.  he has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders.  this has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently.  he does not have any tremor.  he denies any neck pain.  he walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait. recently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control.  oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.  because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep.  he states he has not had a good night&#8217;s sleep in many years.  about six months ago, after an mi and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility.  at that facility, his insulin was stopped.  since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.  he denies any back pain, neck pain, change in bowel or bladder function, or specific injury pre-dating these symptoms. past medical history:  diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, arthritis, gerd, and headaches. medications:  trazodone, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, prevacid, lisinopril, glipizide, and gabapentin. family history:  discussed above and documented on the chart. social history:  discussed above and documented on the chart.  he does not smoke.  he lives in a senior citizens building with daily nursing aids.  he previously was a security guard, but is currently on disability. review of systems:  discussed above and documented on the chart. physical examination:  on examination, blood pressure 150/80, pulse of 80, respiratory rate 22, and weight 360 pounds.  pain scale 7/10.  a full general and neurological examination was performed on the patient and is documented on the chart. the patient is obese with significant ankle edema. neurological examination reveals normal cognitive exam and normal cranial nerve examination.  motor examination reveals mild atrophy in bilateral fdis, but still has a strong grip.  individual muscle strength is close to normal with only subtle weakness found in ankle plantar and dorsiflexion.  tone and bulk are normal.  sensory examination reveals a severe decrease to all modalities in his lower extremities from just above the knees distally.  he has no vibration sense at his knees.  similarly, there is decrease to all sensory modalities in his both upper extremities from just above the wrist distally.  the only reflexes i could obtain with trace reflexes in his biceps.  remaining reflexes were unelicitable.  no babinski.  the patient walks normally with the aid of a cane.  he has severe sensory ataxia with inability to walk unaided.  positive romberg with eyes open and closed. impression and plan:1.  probable painful diabetic neuropathy.  symptoms are predominantly sensory and severely dysfunctioning, with the patient having inability to ambulate independently as well as difficulty with grip and temperature differentiation in his upper extremities.  he has relative preservation of motor function.  because these symptoms are progressive and, by report, he came off his insulin, suggesting somewhat mild diabetes, i would like to rule out other causes of progressive neuropathy.2.  he has history of myoclonic jerks.  i did not see any on my examination today and i feel that these are benign and probably secondary to his severe insomnia, which he states is secondary to the painful neuropathy.  i would like to rule out other causes such as hepatic encephalopathy. i have recommended the following:1.  emg/nerve conduction study to assess severity of neuropathy and to characterize neuropathy.2.  blood work, looking for other causes of neuropathy and myoclonus, to include cbc, cmp, tsh, lft, b12, rpr, esr, lyme titer, and hba1c, and ammonia level.3.  neurontin and oxycodone have not been effective, and i have recommended cymbalta starting at 30 mg q.d. for five days and then increasing to 60 mg q.d.  side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.4.  i have explained to him that progression of diabetic neuropathy is closely related to diabetic control and i have recommended tight diabetic control.5.  i will see him at followup at the emg.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     history of present illness: the patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  at that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  he reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  he was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. he was then well until the 3rd of july 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  this was not preceded by lightheadedness.  he was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  he started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  he again had a fall in august of 2008 after his legs gave way.  again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  he was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  he did not, however, return to the pre-july baseline.  in october of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  he is currently in a chronic rehabilitation unit.  he cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  he states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  he is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  he does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since july 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  he has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in august 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  he does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  he reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  he has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  he also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  this has been present for about nine months.  he has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months. past medical history:1.  pneumonia.  he has had recurrent episodes of pneumonia, which started at approximately age 20.  these have been treated repeatedly over the years, and on average he has tended to have an episode of pneumonia once every five years, although this has been far more frequent in the past year.  he is usually treated with antibiotics and then discharged.  there is no known history of bronchiectasis, inherited lung disease or another chronic pulmonary cause for the repeated pneumonia.2.  he has had a catheter placed for urinary retention, his urologist has told him that he thinks that this may be due to prostate enlargement.  the patient does not have any history of diabetes and does not report any other medical problems.  he has lost approximately 18 pounds in the past month.3.  he had an appendectomy in the 1940s.4.  he had an ankle resection in 1975. social history:  the patient stopped smoking 27 years ago, he smoked approximately two packs a day with combined cigarettes and cigars.  he has not smoked for the past 27 years.  he hardly ever uses alcohol.  he is currently retired. family history:  there is no family history of neuropathy, pes cavus, foot deformities, or neuromuscular diseases.  his aunt has a history of type ii diabetes. current medications:  fludrocortisone 0.1 mg p.o. q.d., midodrine 5 mg p.o. q.i.d., cymbalta 30 mg p.o. per day, prilosec 20 mg p.o. per day, lortab 10 mg p.o. per day, amoxil 500 mg p.o. per day, vitamin b12 1000 mcg weekly, vitamin d 1000

p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. and dilaudid 2 mg tablets p.o. q.3h. p.r.n., protonix 40 mg per day, and megace 400 mg per day. allergies:  he has no medication or food allergies. review of systems:  please see the health questionnaire and clinical notes from today. general physical examination:vital signs:  bp was 137/60, p was 89, and his weight could not be measured because he was in a wheelchair.  his pain score was 0.appearance:  no acute distress.  he is pleasant and well-groomed.heent:  atraumatic, normocephalic.  no carotid bruits appreciated.lungs:  there were few coarse crackles in both lung bases.cardiovascular:  revealed a normal first and second heart sound, with no third or fourth heart sound and no murmurs.  the pulse was regular and of normal volume.abdomen:  soft with no masses and normal bowel sounds.  there were no carotid bruits.extremities:  no contractures appreciated. neurological exam:mse:  his orientation, language, calculations, 100-7 tests were all normal.  there was atrophy and fasciculations in both the arms and legs.cranial nerves:  cranial nerve examination was normal with the exception that there was some mild atrophy of his tongue and possible fasciculations.  his palatal movement was normal and gag reflex was normal.motor:  strength was decreased in all muscle groups as follows:  deltoid 4/4, biceps 4+/4+, triceps 5/5, wrist extensors 4+/4+, finger extensors 4-/4-, finger flexors 4-/4-, interossei 4-/4-, hip flexors 4+/4+, hip extensors 4+/4+, knee extensors 4/4, and knee flexors 4/4.  foot dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, toe extension and toe flexion was all 0 to 1.  there was atrophy in both hands and general atrophy of the lower limb muscles.  the feet were both cold and showed dystrophic features.  fasciculations were present mainly in the hands.  there was evidence of dysmetria and past pointing in the left hand.reflexes:  reflexes were 0 in all sites in the arms and legs.  the jaw reflex was 2+.  vibration was severely decreased at the elbow and wrist and was absent in the fingers.  vibration was absent in the toes and ankle bilaterally and was severely decreased at the knee.  joint position sense was absent in the toes and severely decreased in the fingers.  pin perception was absent in the feet and was decreased to the upper thighs.  pin was decreased or absent in the fingers and decreased above the elbows.  the same distribution of sensory loss was found with monofilament testing.coordination:  coordination was barely normal in the right hand.  rapid alternating movements were decreased in the left hand greater than the right hand.  the patient was unable to stand and therefore gait, romberg&#8217;s test and balance could not be assessed. diagnostic studies:  previous diagnostic studies and patient reports.  there were extensive patient reports, all of which were reviewed.  a previous x-ray study of the lateral chest performed in october 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate.  an x-ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis.  a cta of the neck with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid, a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55% stenosis.  the posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis.  there was no significant stenosis, but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted.  an mri of the brain with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct, major vascular occlusion, and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration.  there was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis.  this was an essentially normal brain mri.  a cbc performed in january 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11.3, a low red cell count of 3.43, elevated mch of 32.4 and the rest of the study was normal.  an electrolyte study performed in january 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127, a calcium which was low at 8.3, and a low protein of 5.2 and albumin of 3.1.  the glucose was 86.  tsh performed in january 2009 was 1.57, which is within the normal range.  vitamin b12 was greater than a 1000, which is normal and the folate was 18.2, which was normal.  a myocardial stress study performed in december 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with persantine cardiolite spect.  the ecg was non-diagnostic.  there was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle.  the left ventricular ejection fraction was 68%, which is within the normal range for males.  a ct of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in december 2008 showed a broad-based disc bulge at l1-l2, l2-l3, l3-l4 and l4-l5.  at l5-s1, in addition to the broad-based disc bulge, there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis.  there was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at l5-s1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at l1-l4.  an echocardiogram was performed in november 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. diagnostic impression:  the patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings.  he is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities, although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities.  his proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities, signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia.  according to the history, which was carefully checked, the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years, although there has only been significant progression in his condition since july 2008.  as indicated below, further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and emg test today showed evidence of a severe sensory, motor, and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy.  there was no involvement of the tongue on emg.  the laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy.  we are still, however, waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies, which were send out lab to the mayo clinic.  this type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as sle, sjogren&#8217;s, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease.  in addition, it may also be seen with certain toxins, particularly chemotherapeutic agents.  the patient did not receive any of these.  it may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.  although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer, it is noted that he has had an 18-pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking.  we have requested that he obtain a ct of his chest, abdomen and pelvis while he is in acute rehabilitation.  the verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer.  we did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm.  the patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy, this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm.  this showed evidence of severe axonal loss.  there was no evidence of a vasculitis.  the vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis.  there were a few perivascular changes; however, there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections.  the muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy, with evidence of fiber grouping.  again, there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis.  evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy, no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy, of sarcoidosis, and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy.  specifically, there is no history of hiv exposure.  we would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis.  at this point, because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy, there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness, unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed.  i have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son.  we also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy.  i think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder. there is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy, and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2.  however, since i have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago, i cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this. plan:1.  nerve conduction and emg will be performed today.  the results were indicated above.2.  the following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes, cbc, thyroid function tests, b12, ana, c-reactive protein, complement, cryoglobulins, double-stranded dna antibodies, folate level, hemoglobin a1c, immunofixation electrophoresis, p-anca, c-anca, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the mayo clinic, b12.  these studies showed minor changes, which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted, a low creatinine of 0.74, low calcium of 8.6, low total protein of 5.7.  the b12 was greater than 2000.  the immunoelectrophoresis, ana, double-stranded dna, anca, hemoglobin a1c, folate, cryoglobulins, complement, c-reactive protein were all normal or negative.  the b12 level was greater than 2000.  liver function tests were normal.  the glucose was 90.  esr was 10.  hemoglobin a1c was 5.5.3.  a left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted as indicated above.4.  ct of chest, abdomen and pelvis.5.  whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm.6.  the patient will go to the rehabilitation facility for acute rehabilitation and training.7.  we have not made any changes to his medication.  he does have some mild orthostatic changes; however, he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 2.5 mg three times a day as needed up to 5 mg four times a day.  usually, he uses a lower dose of 2.5 three times a day to 5 mg three times a day.8.  followup will be as determined by the family.     <!-- 	neuro

~~~ -->     reason for referral:  ms. a is a 60-year-old african-american female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in july.  a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning. relevant background information:  historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with ms. a.  a summary of pertinent information is presented below.  please refer to the patient&#8217;s medical chart for a more complete history. history of presenting problem:  ms. a presented to the abc hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  neurological evaluation with dr. x confirmed left hemiparesis.  brain ct showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received tpa and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  these symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  she was transferred to the icu for monitoring.  ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ica and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ica.  on 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right mca/cva.  at discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all adls and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  she was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  she returned to the sinai er on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt &quot;just like the stroke.&quot;  brain ct on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing &quot;mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,&quot; but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  neurological examination with dr. y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis. followup ct on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  mri could not be completed due to the patient&#8217;s weight.  she was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that ms. a referred to this as a second stroke. ms. a presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with dr. x on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  she demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  during the current interview, ms. a reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  she also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  when asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  she reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the social security agency that she works at.  note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  she also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty. other medical history:  as mentioned, ms. a continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  she was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by dr. x on the need to use her cpap because she indicated she never used it at night.  she reported that since her appointment with dr. x, she has been using it &quot;every other night.&quot;  when asked about daytime fatigue, ms. a initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  she reported at times &quot;snoring&quot; and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  she receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke). current medications:  aspirin 81 mg daily, colace 100 mg b.i.d., lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol mdi p.r.n. substance use:  ms. a denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  she used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago. family medical history:  ms. a had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  she reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer.  her father has gout and blood clots.  siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and gi tumors.  she was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc. social history:  ms. a completed high school degree.  she reported that she primarily obtained b&#8217;s and c&#8217;s in school.  she received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity. she currently works for the social security administration in data processing.  as mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition.  she is now living on her own.  she has never driven.  she reported that she continues to perform adls independently such as cooking and cleaning.  she lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters.  she previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation.  she also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away.  she has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the bahamas at the end of october. psychiatric history:  ms. a did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  she reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  she reported that this only &quot;comes and goes.&quot;

however, it was noted that there was a trade-off between speed and accuracy in her performances on more complex attentional tasks that required greater levels of focus as she tended to complete the task slowly in order to accurately discriminate between target and nontarget visual stimuli.  on a visual sustained attention task, her overall number of errors and response rate were within broad normal limits, but it was noted that her response speed slowed and the accuracy of her responses became less consistent as the test progressed suggesting weaknesses in vigilance.  it was also noted that she was slower to respond and there was more variability in response accuracy when stimuli were presented with longer interstimulus intervals suggesting some weaknesses in arousal and activation when information was presented at a slower rate.  taking together these results highlight deficits in working memory (e.g. complex attention and mental manipulation), sustained attention and vigilance while her more basic and immediate attentional abilities were within broad normal limits.  fatigue was likely a factor in these results.  it is unlikely that ms. a actually fell asleep during this task as her error rate is not very high; however, there were noted decreases in measures that are sensitive to arousal and activation. information processing speed:  as mentioned, ms. a tended to perform within expected limits on brief verbal and visual tasks that involved basic processing.  she had more difficulty maintaining consistency in her response rate and tended to become slower on tasks that require sustained attention and more complex discrimination of stimuli. language:  confrontation naming was in the impaired range, but this may be in part due to lack of familiarity with certain objects given her weak performance on tasks assessing stored verbal knowledge.  minor errors were noted on sentence repetition task, but this may be due to weaknesses in attention and working memory. similarly, her low average performance on a verbal comprehension task may have been due to some weaknesses in vigilance as she was noted to fall asleep at times during this task.  verbal fluency for both phonemic and semantic cues was within the average range.  as taken together some weaknesses in aspects of language appear to have been due to limitations in attention and verbal knowledge store. visuospatial perception and organization:  ms. a performed within the average range and within expected limits on visuospatial construction tasks that involved matching to a sample using either blocks or drawing; however, she had notable difficulties when we attempted to assess her perception of angular line orientations.  these results suggest some reliance on external cues and information for accurate interpretation of visuospatial stimuli and difficulty with perception when such cues are not present to structure her perception.  note that fatigue may have also been a factor here as well. learning &#038; memory skills:   verbal learning and memory:  on contextual memory task (i.e. stories), ms. a performed in the borderline range in immediate recall.  following a delay, she retained 62% of the information that she originally learned and recall was again in the borderline range.  delayed recognition was low average.  on a task assessing her ability to learn large amounts of seemingly unorganized information (i.e. list), her initial acquisition of information was in the low average range.  with repetition, her performance improved and her overall immediate learning fell in the average range.  following a short delay, she was only able to spontaneously recall about a third of the information that she had initially learned and her overall performance fell in the borderline range.  with cueing, she was able to recall more information, but relative to her same age peers this performance still fell in the borderline range.  recall following a long delay was in the borderline to low average range and recognition was borderline as she did not recognize a number of the original target stimuli.  of note, she made a number of repetitions and intrusion errors some of which were semantically related to the list target items and were repeatedly given suggesting some difficulty in correcting her responses with feedback and in monitoring or organizing her responses.  taken together these results highlight difficulties in learning large amounts of verbal information due primarily to difficulties with the initial organizing or learning of the information, although some weaknesses in retrieval were also noted.  these results are likely due to the above noted attention and working memory deficits as she was able to at least recognize most of the information that she had initially learned.   non-verbal/visual learning and memory:  ms. a&#8217;s initial recall of the details in spatial location of the series of visual designs is in the low average range.  she retained most of this information following a delay with recall and recognition falling in the average range.  immediate recall of a complex figure drawing was in the average range.  following a 30-minute delay, she retained most of this information although statistically her result fell in the low average range.  recognition of the individual component parts of the larger figure fell in the low average range.  taken together these results suggest that ms. a was mildly limited in the amount of information that she could initially learn, but the fact that she was able to retain most of that information over time suggests that any difficulties in learning visual information occurred during initial encoding.  this pattern of results is similar to those found for verbal information. executive functioning:  ms. a performed within the low average-to-average range on tasks assessing verbal fluency, cognitive set shifting, and inhibition of prepotent responses; however, it should be noted that ms. a made a number of errors on these tasks particularly for inhibition, although she was able to successfully correct those errors. across tasks and during interactions it was noted that ms. a had some weaknesses in organization.  visual and verbal abstract reasoning were in the borderline range and deficits in working memory were noted.  taken together these results highlight some weaknesses in executive functioning. motor/psychomotor functioning:  ms. a performed in the impaired range with her dominant right hand and her nondominant hand on a task assessing speeded fine motor coordination. emotional functioning:  ms. a&#8217;s overall score on a self-report effective screening measure suggested that she is currently experiencing mild levels of depression.  she endorsed symptoms related to dysphoria, anxiety, lack of energy, anhedonia, hopelessness, and cognitive problems. summary &#038; impressions:  ms. a was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x, m.d. to follow up noted cognitive weaknesses following a right middle cerebral artery stroke that was seen on a neuropsychological screening.  test results suggested that ms. a was premorbidly performing in the low average to average range.  based on this estimate, she performed within expected limits on tasks assessing immediate attention and speed for processing brief, simple, and straightforward information.  most aspects of language (i.e. repetition, comprehension, and fluency), and visuospatial construction (i.e. matching to sample).  deficits were seen primarily in the areas of complex attention or working memory and sustained attention.  she had difficulty mentally manipulating information in mind and on longer task that required focus.  she demonstrated poor vigilance, difficulty with discrimination of stimuli, and declines in arousal and activation.  these attentional deficits affected her ability to learn verbal and visual information.  weaknesses in executive functioning were also noted based on her performances across tasks as well as behavioral observations as she demonstrated weaknesses in abstract thinking, organization, inhibition, and behavioral and response regulation.  combined with the deficits seen for fine motor skills, these results are consistent with frontal subcortical changes as were seen on her cat scan.  in addition, ms. a demonstrated some difficulty completing a task that involved interpreting directionally based visuospatial stimuli in the absence of other cues to aid with perception and these findings may be consistent with the involvement of the right hemisphere in her recent stroke; however, given that no mri was conducted it is difficult to say whether or not there are specific regions of infarct in her right hemisphere. overall, these results are consistent with those seen on her recent neuropsychological screening.  this evaluation was requested in order to further clarify those results.  as noted above, ms. a does have a number of areas of deficit; however, these results do not support a dementing process at this time.  the pattern of findings as mentioned are consistent with subcortical changes, but may also be secondary to her poorly treated sleep apnea as she was noticeably tired and particular deficits were noticed on tasks that required complex or sustained attention.  thus it will be important for ms. a to increase compliance with treatment for sleep apnea and also to ensure that other cardiovascular risk factors are monitored and controlled through diet, exercise, and medication.  given that she is working full-time and these cognitive deficits could create significant problems on the job, it will be important that ms. a address these issues while she is still completing a lighter load at work.  additional recommendations are provided below. recommendations:1.  it is imperative that ms. a address her sleep apnea and comply consistently i.e. every evening with wearing her cpap.  given that she continues to complain about it and report the claustrophobia prevents her from using it regularly, ms. a should see a sleep specialist in order to determine alternate ways to address this problem.2.  ms. a reported mild levels of depression and anxiety on this evaluation and it was previously recommended that she contact xyz to inquire about counseling and management of multiple life stressors.3.  ms. a should see an ophthalmologist to update her eyeglass prescription.  it may have contributed to the noted deficits on one visuospatial task.4.  continued pt and home exercises i recommended to improve physical abilities.5.  ms. a is likely not obtaining enough physical exercise and it is suggested that she work with her physical therapist and primary care physician to determine exercise regimen in order to help her lose weight.6.  the following recommendations are provided to aid ms. a with the noted difficulties with attention and memory.  she may also benefit from cognitive therapy in order to learn to apply these strategies at work.7.  ms. a&#8217;s cardio and cerebrovascular risk factors should be closely monitored and the results of this evaluation should be shared with all of her physicians. thank you for referring this interesting patient for evaluation.  a neuropsychological reevaluation is recommended in one to two years in order to monitor cognitive functioning.  reevaluation should occur earlier if there is any worsening of cognitive functioning.     <!-- 	neuro
~~~ -->     history of present illness:  the patient is a 69-year-old single caucasian female with a past medical history of schizoaffective disorder, diabetes, osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, gerd, and dyslipidemia who presents to the emergency room with the complaint of &quot;manic&quot; symptoms due to recent medication adjustments.  the patient had been admitted to st. luke&#8217;s hospital on month dd, yyyy for altered mental status and at that time, the medical team discontinued zyprexa and lithium.  in the emergency room, the patient reported elevated mood, pressured speech, irritability, decreased appetite, and impulsivity.  she also added that over the past three days, she felt more confused and reported having blackouts as well as hallucinations about white lines and dots on her arms and face from the medication changes.  she was admitted voluntarily to the inpatient unit and medications were not restarted for her.  on the unit this morning, the patient is loud and nonredirectable, she is singing loudly and speaking in a very pressured manner.  she reports that she would like to speak with dr. a, the neurologist who saw her at st. luke&#8217;s, because she &quot;trust him.&quot;  the patient is somewhat reluctant to answer questions stating that she has answered enough of people&#8217;s questions; however, she is talkative and reports that she feels as though she needs a sedative.  the patient reports that she is originally from brooklyn, new york, and she moved down to houston about a year ago to be with her daughter.  she also expressed frustration over the fact that her daughter wanted her removed from the apartment she was in initially and had her placed in a nursing home due to inability to care for herself.  the patient also complains that her daughter is &quot;trying to tell me what medications to take.&quot;  the patient sees dr. b in the woodlands for outpatient care. past psychiatric history:  per chart.  the patient has been mentally ill for over 30 years with past diagnoses of bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia.  she has been stable on lithium and zyprexa according to her daughter and was recently taken off those medications, changed to seroquel, and the daughter reports that she has decompensated since then.  it is not known whether the patient has had prior psychiatric inpatient admissions;

~~~ -->     identification of patient:  the patient is a 34-year-old caucasian female. chief complaint:  depression. history of present illness:  the patient&#8217;s depression began in her teenage years.  sleep has been poor, for multiple reasons.  she has obstructive sleep apnea, and has difficulties with a child who has insomnia related to medications that he takes.  the patient tends to feel irritable, and has crying spells.  she sometimes has problems with motivation.  she has problems with memory, and energy level is poor. appetite has been poor, but without weight change.  because of her frequent awakening, her cpap machine monitor has indicated she is not using it enough, and medicaid is threatening to refuse to pay for the machine.  she does not have suicidal thoughts.   the patient also has what she describes as going into a &quot;panic mode.&quot;  during these times, she feels as if her whole body is going to explode.  she has a hard time taking a deep breath, her heart rate goes up, blood pressure is measured as higher shortly afterward, and she gets a sense of impending doom.  these spells may last a couple of hours, but once lasted for about two day.  she does not get chest pain.  these attacks tend to be precipitated by bills that cannot be paid, or being on a &quot;time crunch.&quot;  psychiatric history:  the patient&#8217;s nurse practitioner had started her on cymbalta, up to 60 mg per day. this was helpful, but then another physician switched her to wellbutrin in the hope that this would help her quit smoking.  although she was able to cut down on tobacco usage, the depression has been more poorly controlled.  she has used wellbutrin up to 200 mg b.i.d. and cymbalta up to 60 mg per day, at different times.  at age 13, the patient cut her wrists because of issues with a boyfriend, and as she was being sutured she realized that this was a very stupid thing to do.  she has never been hospitalized for psychiatric purposes.  she did see a psychologist at age 16 briefly because of prior issues in her life, but she did not fully reveal information, and it was deemed that she did not need services.  she has not previously spoken with a psychiatrist, but has been seeing a therapist, stephanie kitchen, at this facility. substance abuse history:caffeine:  the patient has two or three drinks per day of tea or diet pepsi.tobacco:  she smokes about one pack of cigarettes per week since being on wellbutrin, and prior to that time had been smoking one-half pack per day.  she is still committed to quitting.alcohol: denied.illicit drugs:  denied.  in her earlier years, someone once put some unknown drug in her milk, and she &quot;came to&quot; when she was dancing on the table in front of the school nurse. medical history/review of systems:constitutional:  see history of present illness. no recent fever or sweats.   neurological:  no history of seizures.  she does have migraine headaches, and has been diagnosed with restless leg syndrome.  when she was small, she twice fell on cinder blocks and struck her head, losing consciousness; she has a facial scar from one of those incidents.  when she was about 3 or 4 years of age, they were playing baseball with a cup being used as a ball, and her brother accidentally hit her in the forehead with a bat; she did not lose consciousness that time.  heent:  the patient states she needs glasses, but cannot afford them. cardiovascular:  hypertension.  pulmonary:  obstructive sleep apnea.  gastrointestinal:  recurrent epigastric pain, relieved by prevacid.  no history of liver disease.  endocrine and hematological:  the patient is hypothyroid, has diabetes mellitus, but no hematological disorder.  dermatological:  denied.  musculoskeletal:  chronic back pain.  the patient has had some nerve ablation, but feels the nerves have been growing back, as the pain has worsened.  she also has right knee pain.  genitourinary:  stress incontinence.  other:  obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  surgeries:  bilateral tubal ligation, and partial hysterectomy in 2003 for menorrhagia.  she has had several miscarriages. allergies:  penicillin and tetanus. current medications:prescription:  wellbutrin 200 mg b.i.d., but she has been given a prescription for cymbalta 30 mg per day, which she was instructed to start within the next few days.  she also takes ambien (ineffective), l-thyroxin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, zocor, an unknown medication for restless legs, ultram, lidoderm patch, and zanaflex. she also takes prevacid.over-the-counter:  multivitamins.herbal:  denied. developmental history:  the patient was born fullterm, vaginally, after a normal pregnancy.  she walked around the furniture at 9 months of age, but did not walk by herself until 14 months of age. abuse history/trauma/unusual childhood events:   the patient was molested by cousins and by her mother&#8217;s boyfriends.  her parents separated when she was 2 years of age, and divorced just before sixth birthday.  her mother often had parties, and the children were unsupervised.  she was raped at age 15 by a boyfriend.   family psychiatric history:  her son has adhd.  her daughter has depression. her mother has depression and possibly even bipolar disorder.  her mother has had substance abuse issues, primarily cannabis and alcohol, but other drugs as well.  her great grandmother on her father&#8217;s side has alzheimer&#8217;s disease. family medical history:  the patient&#8217;s mother was adopted, so she only recently learned about family medical history.  an aunt has hypothyroidism, and there is diabetes mellitus on both sides of the family.  there are also individuals with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, an unknown type of cancer, hypertension, and obesity.   social history:  the patient was born in savannah, georgia.  she came to alaska in 2001 because her husband had lost his trucking job (the company filed bankruptcy) and they had become homeless in south carolina.  because her mother was residing in alaska, her husband sent her here, but shortly thereafter they were evicted from that home as well; the building was being sold.  she has a daughter, age 13, and twins (a boy and a girl), age 10.  she has been married for 14 years.  she is presently unemployed, but plans to go on a job interview today with alaska usa federal credit union.  she is of pentecostal faith, but only occasionally attends church.  they have had some major difficulties with their church of choice.  at one point, the youth pastor accused her husband of stealing his laptop computer and a credit card; although, it was later found that one of the young people in the church had been the culprit, and no one ever apologized to her husband.  later on, they were assisting the new youth pastor with a yard sale, and someone stole the proceeds from the sale, as well as some discount cards.  her husband was again accused, but it was later learned through tracing the discount cards who the thief was.  they feel that the people in the church have viewed them suspiciously, and have not apologized for the false accusations.   educational:  she quit high school twice, the second time being before the last semester of her senior year.  she later earned a ged, after being married. legal:  she has never been charged with any crime, but was once accused of carrying a knife that was too long by perhaps a quarter inch. mental status:  the patient is alert, pleasant, and cooperative.  she arrived on time.  grooming is fair to good.  intelligence is at least average.  she is oriented to time, place and person.  eye contact is good.  she is able to spell the word &quot;world&quot;

has been hospitalized four times over the past year due to cognitive problem, disorientation and bizarre behaviors.  at this time, mr. abc is experiencing some mood disturbance.  it appears that this might be secondary to his health problems but given the claimant&#8217;s tendencies to minimize his mental health symptoms and to fail to give adequate historical details, it is difficult to know for sure.  based on presentation, intellectually and cognitively, it is believed that mr. abc could not complete work-related tasks satisfactorily.  emotionally and socially, it is believed that he could not tolerate work stressors and could not adjust to a work environment and schedule.  at this time, it is believed that his cognitive dysfunction would be a hindrance to him in a work setting.   capability:  if mr. abc were to receive benefits, it appears that he would not need a payee.     <!-- 	psych

bipolar illness in his immediate family, but there is some depression.  a recent stressor involved ocs involvement, apparently because his infant child tested positive for thc.  so far as i am aware, this case is closed at this time.   behavioral observations:  mr. abcd arrived on time for his testing session dressed casually and with good hygiene and grooming.  mood is reported to be generally okay, though with some stress.  affect was bright and appropriate to the situation.  speech was a little pressured, but was of normal content and was at all times coherent and goal directed.  he was a very pleasant and cooperative testing subject, who appeared to give a good effort on the tasks requested of him.  the results appear to provide a useful sample of his current attitudes, opinions, and functional levels in the areas assessed. assessment results:  mr. abcd&#8217;s responses to a brief self-report instrument given to him by dr. starks was suggestive of symptoms that could be consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  i therefore had him complete the conners cpt-ii, which showed good performance and no indications of attention problems.  the confidence index associated with adhd was over 58 percent that no clinical attention problems are present.  while a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder should not unequivocally be ruled out based on the results of this test, there is nothing in the cpt-ii measures indicating attention problems, and that diagnosis appears to be unlikely.  the mmpi-2 profile is a technically valid and interpretable one.  the modified welsh code is as follows:  49+86-231/570:  f&#8217;+-/:lk#.  the high f scale may reflect some moodiness, restlessness, dissatisfaction, and changeableness in his typical behavior.  the basic clinical profile is similar to persons who tend to get into trouble for violating social norms and rules.  such persons are more likely to experience conflicts with authority.  they also are prone to impulsivity, self-indulgence, problems with delay of gratification, exercise problematic judgment, and often have low frustration tolerance.  those with similar scores tend to be moody, irritable, extraverted, and often do not trust others very much.  mr. abcd may tend to keep others at a distance, yet feel rather insecure and dependent.  a bipolar diagnosis is a possibility, and an antisocial personality disorder cannot be entirely ruled out either, though i am less confident that that is correct.  the mmpi-2 content scale scores indicate some mild depression and family stressors, and the supplementary scales has a single clinical elevation on addiction admission, which is entirely consistent with his interview data.  posttraumatic stress scales are not elevated at a clear clinical level on the mmpi-2. summary and recommendations:   mr. abcd certainly has multiple stressors in his life, and i suspect that some of his reported attention and concentration difficulties are more related to those problems than to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  conners cpt-ii results do not provide support for that diagnosis, and in the absence of other data, i would tend to rule out adhd at this time.  the mmpi-2 profile indicates some problems with impulsivity, family stressors, and mild depressive symptoms.  posttraumatic stress disorder scales do not reach clinical significance.  the profile suggests some impulsivity, restlessness, moodiness, irritability, problems with frustration tolerance, poor decision making, and potential conflicts with authority.  a bipolar spectrum disorder diagnosis is a possibility and i would recommend exploring treatment options to further examine and address this.  an antisocial personality disorder may be present, or traits of antisocial personality may be present, but at this point, i do not see sufficient evidence to warrant that diagnosis.     <!-- 	psych

the patient is admitted on a 72-hour involuntary treatment act for grave disability. history of present illness:  the patient has minimal insight into the circumstances that resulted in this admission.  he reports being diagnosed with aids and schizophrenia for some time, but states he believes that he has maintained his stable baseline for many months of treatment for either condition.  prior to admission, the patient was brought to emergency room after he attempted to shoplift from a local department store, during which he apparently slapped his partner.  the patient was disorganized with police and emergency room staff, and he was ultimately detained on a 72-hour involuntary treatment act for grave disability. on the interview, the patient is still disorganized and confused.  he believes that he has been arrested and is in jail.  reports a history of mental health treatment, but denies benefiting from this in the past and does not think that it is currently necessary. i was able to contact his partner by telephone.  his partner reports the patient is paranoid and has bizarre behavior at baseline over the time that he has known him for the last 16 years, with occasional episodes of symptomatic worsening, from which he spontaneously recovers.  his partner estimates the patient spends about 20% of the year in episodes of worse symptoms.  his partner states that in the last one to two months, the patient has become worse than he has ever seen him with increased paranoia above the baseline and he states the patient has been barricading himself in his house and unplugging all electrical appliances for unclear reasons.  he also reports the patient has been sleeping less and estimates his average duration to be three to four hours a night.  he also reports the patient has been spending money impulsively in the last month and has actually incurred overdraft charges on his checking account on three different occasions recently.  he also reports that the patient has been making threats of harm to him and that his partner no longer feels that he is safe having him at home.  he reports that the patient has been eating regularly with no recent weight loss.  he states that the patient is observed responding to internal stimuli, occasionally at baseline, but this has gotten worse in the last few months.  his partner was unaware of any obvious medical changes in the last one to two months coinciding with onset of recent symptomatic worsening.  he reports of the patient&#8217;s longstanding poor compliance with treatment of his mental health or age-related conditions and attributes this to the patient&#8217;s dislike of taking medicine.  he also reports that the patient has expressed the belief in the past that he does not suffer from either condition. past psychiatric history:  the patient&#8217;s partner reports that the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 20s and he has been hospitalized on two occasions in the 1980s and that there was a third admission to a psychiatric facility, but the date of this admission is currently unknown.  the patient was last enrolled in an outpatient mental health treatment in mid 2009.  he dropped out of care about six months ago when he moved with his partner.  his partner reports the patient was most recently prescribed seroquel, which, though the patient denied benefiting from, his partner felt was &quot;useful, but not dosed high enough.&quot; past medication trials that the patient reports include haldol and lithium, neither of which he found to be particularly helpful. medical history:  the patient reports being diagnosed with hiv and aids in 1994 and believes this was secondary to unprotected sexual contact in the years prior to his diagnosis.  he is currently followed at clinic, where he has both an assigned physician and a case manager, but treatment compliance has been poor with no use of antiretroviral meds in the last year.  the patient is fairly vague on his history of aids related conditions, but does identify the following:  thrush, skin lesions, and lung infections; additional details of these problems are not currently known. current medications:  none. allergies:  no known drug allergies. social and developmental history:  the patient lives with his partner.  he is unemployed.  details of his educational and occupational history are not currently known.  his source of finances is also unknown, though social security disability is presumed. substance and alcohol history:  the patient smoked one to two packs per day for most of the last year, but has increased this to two to three packs per day in the last month.  his partner reports that the patient consumed alcohol occasionally, but denies any excessive or binge use recently.  the patient reports smoking marijuana a few times in his life, but not recently.  denies other illicit substance use. legal history:  unknown. genetic psychiatric history:  also unknown. mental status exam:attitude:  the patient demonstrates only variable cooperation with interview, requires frequent redirection to respond to questions.  his appearance is cachectic.  the patient is poorly groomed.psychomotor:  there is no psychomotor agitation or retardation.  no other observed extrapyramidal symptoms or tardive dyskinesia.affect:  his affect is fairly detached.mood:  describes his mood is &quot;okay.&quot;speech:  his speech is normal rate and volume.  tone, his volume was decreased initially, but this improved during the course of the interview.thought process:  his thought processes are markedly tangential.thought content:  the patient is fairly scattered.  he will provide history with frequent redirection, but he does not appear to stay on one topic for any length of time.  he denies currently auditory or visual hallucinations, though his partner says that this is a feature present at baseline.  paranoid delusions are elicited.homicidal/suicidal ideation:  he denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.  denies previous suicide attempts.cognitive assessment:  cognitively, he is alert and oriented to person and year only.  his memory is intact to names of his madison clinic providers.insight/judgment:  his insight is absent as evidenced by his repeated questioning of the validity of his aids and mental health diagnoses.  his judgment is poor as evidenced by his longstanding pattern of minimal engagement in treatment of his mental health and physical health conditions.assets:  his assets include his housing and his history of supportive relationship with his partner over many years.limitations:  his limitations include his aids and his history of poor compliance with treatment. formulation:  the patient is a 45-year-old white male with a history of schizophrenia and aids.  he was admitted for disorganized and assaultive behaviors while off all medications for the last six months.  it is unclear to me how much his presentation is a direct expression of an aids-related condition, though i suspect the impact of his hiv status is likely to be substantial. diagnoses:axis i:  schizophrenia by history.  rule out aids-induced psychosis.  rule out aids-related cognitive disorder.axis ii:  deferred.axis iii:  aids (stable by his report).  anemia.axis iv:  relationship strain and the possibility that he may be unable to return to his home upon discharge;

~~~ -->     history of present illness:  this is a 23-year-old married man who had an onset of aplastic anemia in december, underwent a bone marrow transplant in the end of march, has developed very severe graft-versus-host reaction.  psychiatric consultation has been requested as the patient has been noncompliant with treatment, leave the unit, does not return when requested, and it was unclear as to whether this is secondary to confusion or willful behavior. the patient gives a significant history of behavioral problems from late adolescence until the onset of illness, states he had lot of trouble with law, he was convicted of assault, he was also arrested with small amount of cannabis, states he served one year incarcerated in abcd that was about two years ago.  gives an ongoing history of substance abuse until one year ago when he went into a drug rehabilitation program, he was discharged from that on 05/28/2006 and states he has been clean and sober since then.  prior to going to rehabilitation, he was using intravenous heroin couple of times a week since age 17, which would have been over a period of about five years, reports heavy use of cannabis, smoking pot up to five times a day if he could.  he would drink up to half of a fifth of rum on a daily basis when available. the patient is currently on lexapro 10 mg in the morning and diazepam 10 mg at bedtime.  he complained of some depressive and some anxiety symptoms, but these do not appear to be out of proportion to his medical issues and, for this individual, the frustrations of his treatments.  he would have a limited support system here in colorado.  he married in january and states that the marriage is not going particularly well, being young, sick, and hospitalized, has not helped his relationship with his new wife who apparently is expecting a child in july.  i would recommend some couples counseling as a part of their treatment here. the patient was fairly drowsy during the interview and full past and developmental history was not obtained.  the patient&#8217;s comment is that he grew up all over, that his parents had separated, that he lived with his mother, that he dropped out of school in eleventh grade, at that time was living in xyz area because he did not like school. physical examination:  general:  this is a cooperative man, speech is soft and difficult to understand.  there is no thought disorder and no hallucination.  he denies being suicidal, but does express at times feelings about giving up on his treatments and primarily complaints about feeling that he is treated like a child and confined in the hospital.vital signs:  temperature 97.2, pulse 117, respirations 16, blood pressure 127/74, oxygen saturation 97%, and weight is 154 pounds.psychiatry:  there is no thought disorder, no paranoia, no delusions, and no psychotic symptoms.  activities of daily living (adls) appear intact.  on formal testing, he is oriented to place.  he can give a reasonable recitation of his medical history.  he is oriented to the year, knows it is the 15th, but gave the month as june instead of may.  he can memorize four items, repeats three out of four at five minutes, gives the fourth through the category, which places short-term memory in normal limits.  he can do serial three subtractions accurately, can name objects appropriately. laboratory data:  sodium of 135, bun of 24, and glucose 119.  ggt of 355, alt of 97, ldh of 703, and alk phos of 144.  fk506 is 28.8, which is elevated tacrolimus level.  hematocrit 29% and white count is 7000. diagnoses:  axis i:  depressive disorder secondary to the underlying medical condition of graft-versus-host reaction.axis ii:  personality disorder, not otherwise specified (nos).axis iii:  history of polysubstance abuse, in remission. recommendations:  1.  this patient appears to retain the ability to make decisions on his own behalf.  i think he is mentally competent.  unfortunately, his impulsive low frustration personality dynamics do not fit well with the demands and requirements for treatment of this chronic illness.  if the patient refuses treatment, he understands that the consequences of this would likely be hastened mortality and he does state that he does not want to die.2.  the patient does complain of depressed mood, also of anxiety.  we did discuss medications.  he appeared somewhat sedated at the time of my interview.  i would recommend that we try seroquel 25 mg twice daily on an as-needed basis to see if this diminishes anxiety.  i will have dr. x followup with him. please feel free to contact me at digital pager if additional information is needed. my overall recommendation would be that the patient be on some random urine drug screening, that he use cell phone if he goes off the unit, to be called back up when treatments are scheduled, and hopefully he will be agreeable to complying with this.     <!-- 	psych

~~~ -->     history:  the patient is a 19-year-old boy with a membranous pulmonary atresia, underwent initial repair 12/04/1987 consisting of pulmonary valvotomy and placement of 4 mm gore-tex shunt between the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery with a snare.  this was complicated by shunt thrombosis __________ utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  resulting in significant hypoxic brain injury where he has been left with static encephalopathy and cerebral palsy.  on 04/07/1988, he underwent heart catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  he has been followed conservatively since that time.  a recent echocardiogram demonstrated possibly a significant right ventricle outflow tract obstruction with tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity predicting a right ventricular systolic pressure in excess of 180 mmhg.  right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula was also appreciated.  the patient underwent cardiac catheterization to assess hemodynamics associated with his current state of repair. procedure:  the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing on 30% oxygen throughout the case.  cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures. using a 7-french sheath, a 6-french wedge catheter was inserted.  the right femoral vein advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries.  this catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 5-french marker pigtail catheter, which was directed into the main pulmonary artery. using a 5-french sheath, a 5-french pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  this catheter was then exchanged for a judkins right coronary catheter for selective cannulation of the right coronary artery. flows were calculated by the fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity. cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the main pulmonary artery and right coronary artery. after angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  there were no complications. discussion:  oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  mixed venous saturation was normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  left-sided heart was fully saturated.  phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an a-wave similar to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  right ventricular systolic pressure was mildly elevated at 45% systemic level.  there was a 25 mmhg peak systolic gradient across the outflow tract to the main branch pulmonary arteries.  phasic branch pulmonary artery pressures were normal.  right-to-left pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an a-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmhg.  left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.  the calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal.  vascular resistances were normal.  angiogram with contrast injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency.  the right ventricle appeared mildly hypoplastic with a good contractility and mild tricuspid valve regurgitation.  there is dynamic narrowing of the infundibulum with hypoplastic pulmonary annulus.  the pulmonary valve appeared to be thin and moved well.  the median branch pulmonary arteries were of good size with normal distal arborization.  angiogram with contrast injection in the right coronary artery showed a non-dominant coronary with a small fistula arising from the proximal right coronary artery coursing over the infundibulum and entering the left facing sinus of the main pulmonary artery. initial diagnoses:1.  membranous pulmonary atresia.2.  atrial septal defect.3.  right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula. surgeries (interventions):  1.  pulmonary valvotomy surgical.2.  aortopulmonary artery central shunt.3.  balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. current diagnoses:  1.  pulmonary valve stenosis supplemented to hypoplastic pulmonary annulus.2.  mild right ventricle outflow tract obstruction due to supple pulmonic narrowing.3.  small right coronary artery to main pulmonary fistula.4.  static encephalopathy.5.  cerebral palsy. management:  the case to be discussed with combined cardiology/cardiothoracic surgery case conference.  given the mild degree of outflow tract obstruction in this sedentary patient, aggressive intervention is not indicated.  conservative outpatient management is to be recommended.  further patient care will be directed by dr. x.     <!-- 	pulmo

~~~ -->     history:  the patient is a 9-year-old born with pulmonary atresia, intact ventricular septum with coronary sinusoids.  he also has vacterl association with hydrocephalus.  as an infant, he underwent placement of a right modified central shunt.  on 05/26/1999, he underwent placement of a bidirectional glenn shunt, pulmonary artery angioplasty, takedown of the central shunt, pda ligation, and placement of a 4 mm left-sided central shunt.  on 08/01/2006, he underwent cardiac catheterization and coil embolization of the central shunt.  a repeat catheterization on 09/25/2001 demonstrated elevated glenn pressures and significant collateral vessels for which he underwent embolization.  he then underwent repeat catheterization on 11/20/2003 and further embolization of residual collateral vessels.  blood pressures were found to be 13 mmhg with the pulmonary vascular resistance of 2.6-3.1 wood units.  on 03/22/2004, he returned to the operating room and underwent successful 20 mm extracardiac fontan with placement of an 8-mm fenestration and main pulmonary artery ligation.  a repeat catheterization on 09/07/2006, demonstrated mildly elevated fontan pressures in the context of a widely patent fontan fenestration and intolerance of fontan fenestration occlusion.  the patient then followed conservatively since that time.  the patient is undergoing a repeat evaluation to assess his candidacy for a fontan fenestration occlusion, as well as consideration for a tricuspid valvuloplasty in attempt to relieve right ventricular hypertension and associated membranous ventricular aneurysm protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract. procedure:  after sedation and local xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures. using a 7-french sheath, a 6-french wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava along the fontan conduit into the main left pulmonary artery, as well as the superior vena cava.  this catheter was then exchanged for a 5-french vs catheter of a distal wire.  apposition of the right pulmonary artery over, which the wedge catheter was advanced.  the wedge catheter could then be easily advanced across the fontan fenestration into the right atrium and guidewire manipulation allowed access across the atrial septal defect to the pulmonary veins, left atrium, and left ventricle. using a 5-french sheath, a 5-french pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  attempt was then made to cross the tricuspid valve from the right atrium and guidewire persisted to prolapse through the membranous ventricular septum into the left ventricle.  the catheter distal wire position was finally achieved across what appeared to be the posterior aspect of the tricuspid valve, both angiographically as well as equal guidance.  left ventricular pressure was found to be suprasystemic.  a balloon valvoplasty was performed using a ranger 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with no waste at minimal inflation pressure.  echocardiogram, which showed no significant change in the appearance of a tricuspid valve and persistence of aneurysmal membranous ventricular septum.  further angioplasty was then performed first utilizing a 6 mm cutting balloon directed through 7-french flexor sheath positioned within the right atrium.  there was a disappearance of a mild waist prior to spontaneous tear of the balloon.  the balloon catheter was then removed in its entirety. echocardiogram again demonstrated no change in the appearance of the tricuspid valve.  a final angioplasty was performed utilizing a 80 mm cutting balloon with the disappearance of a distinctive waste.  echocardiogram; however, demonstrated no change and intact appearing tricuspid valve and no decompression of the right ventricle.  further attempts to cross tricuspid valve were thus abandoned.  attention was then directed to a fontan fenestration.  a balloon occlusion then demonstrated minimal increase in fontan pressures from 12 mmhg to 15 mmhg.  with less than 10% fall in calculated cardiac index.  the angiogram in the inferior vena cava demonstrated a large fenestration measuring 6.6 mm in diameter with a length of 8 mm.  a 7-french flexor sheath was again advanced cross the fenestration.  a 10-mm amplatzer muscular ventricular septal defect occluder was loaded on delivery catheter and advanced through the sheath where the distal disk was allowed to be figured in the right atrium.  entire system was then brought into the fenestration and withdrawal of the sheath allowed reconfiguration of the proximal disk.  once the stable device configuration was confirmed, device was released from the delivery catheter.  hemodynamic assessment and the angiograms were then repeated. flows were calculated by the fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity. angiograms with injection in the right coronary artery, left coronary artery, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and right ventricle. after angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  there were no complications. discussion:  oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  mixed venous saturation was low due to systemic arterial desaturation.  there was modest increased saturation of the branch pulmonary arteries due to the presumed aortopulmonary collateral flow.  the right pulmonary veins were fully saturated.  left pulmonary veins were not entered.  there was a fall in saturation within the left ventricle and descending aorta due to a right to left shunt across the fontan fenestration.  mean fontan pressures were 12 mmhg with a 1 mmhg fall in mean pressure into the distal left pulmonary artery.  right and left pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were similar to left atrial phasic pressure with an a-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 11 mmhg.  left ventricular systolic pressure was normal with at most 5 mmhg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the ascending aorta.  phasic ascending and descending aortic pressures were similar and normal.  the calculated systemic flow was normal.  pulmonary flow was reduced to the qt-qs ratio of 0.7621.  pulmonary vascular resistance was normal at 1 wood units. angiogram with injection in the right coronary artery demonstrated diminutive coronary with an extensive sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  the left coronary angiogram showed a left dominant system with a brisk flow to the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries.  there was communication to the right-sided coronary sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  angiogram with injection in the superior vena cava showed patent right bidirectional glenn shunt with mild narrowing of the proximal right pulmonary artery, as well as the central pulmonary artery, diameter of which was augmented by the glenn anastomosis and the fontan anastomosis.  there was symmetric contrast flow to both pulmonary arteries.  a large degree of contrast flowed retrograde into the fontan and shunting into the right atrium across the fenestration.  there is competitive flow to the upper lobes presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  the branch pulmonaries appeared mildly hypoplastic.  levo phase contrast returned into the heart, appeared unobstructed demonstrating good left ventricular contractility.  angiogram with injection in the fontan showed a widely patent anastomosis with the inferior vena cava.  majority of the contrast flowing across the fenestration into the right atrium with a positive flow to the branch pulmonary arteries. following the device occlusion of fontan fenestration, the fontan and mean pressure increased to 15 mmhg with a 3 mmhg, a mean gradient in the distal left pulmonary artery and no gradient into the right pulmonary artery.  there was an increase in the systemic arterial pressures.  mixed venous saturation increased from the resting state as with increase in systemic arterial saturation to 95%.  the calculated systemic flow increased slightly from the resting state and pulmonary flow was similar with a qt-qs ratio of 0.921.  angiogram with injection in the inferior vena cava showed a stable device configuration with a good disk apposition to the anterior surface of the fontan with no protrusion into the fontan and no residual shunt and no obstruction to a fontan flow.  an ascending aortogram that showed a left aortic arch with trace aortic insufficiency and multiple small residual aortopulmonary collateral vessels arising from the intercostal arteries.  a small degree of contrast returned to the heart. initial diagnoses:  1.  pulmonary atresia.2.  vacterl association.3.  persistent sinusoidal right ventricle to the coronary

~~~ -->     chart note:  she is here to discuss possible open lung biopsy that she has actually scheduled for tomorrow.  dr. xyz had seen her because of her complaints of shortness of breath.  then she had the pulmonary function test and ct scan and he felt that she probably had usual interstitial pneumonitis, but wanted her to have an open lung biopsy so he had her see dr. xyz estep.  he had concurred with dr. xyz that an open lung biopsy was appropriate and she was actually scheduled for this but both dr. xyz and i were unavailable before the procedure was originally scheduled so he had it delayed so that she could talk with us prior to having the biopsy.  she was ready to go ahead with this and felt that it was important she find out why she is short of breath.  she is very concerned about the findings on her cat scan and pulmonary function test.  she seemed alarmed to report that dr. xyz had found that her lung capacity was reduced to 60% of what should be normal.  however, i told her that two years ago dr. xyz did pulmonary function studies which showed the same change in function.  and that really her pulmonary function test, at least compared from two years ago, had not really changed over this period of time.  after discussing the serious nature of an open lung biopsy, the fact that her pulmonary function studies have not changed in two years, the fact that she likely has a number of other things that are contributing to her being out of breath, which is deconditioning and obesity, she seemed comfortable with the thought of simply monitoring this a little bit longer before undergoing something as risky as an open lung biopsy.  in fact when i called dr. xyz to talk to him about cancelling the procedure, he stated he would be very uncomfortable with doing an open lung biopsy on someone with pulmonary function studies which had not changed.  i also explained to patient that i did not think dr. xyz was aware that she had had pulmonary function studies two years previously and certainly did not know that there results of those.  and also i spoke with dr. xyz who agreed that although the two different tests may have some minor differences accounting for some of the similarity in results that may or may not be completely accurate, that generally a person with progressive interstitial lung disease without a fairly substantial change on pulmonary function tests even if they were done at different facilities. i had a 30-minute discussion with patient about all of this and showed her the different test results and had a lengthy talk with her about the open lung biopsy and she ultimately felt very uncomfortable with going ahead and decided to cancel it.  i also told her we could continue to monitor her breathing problems and continue to monitor her cat scan, x-ray, and pulmonary function tests.  and if there was some sign that this was a progressive problem, she could still go ahead with the lung biopsy.  but she needed to understand that the treatment and likely diagnosis found from an open lung biopsy were not highly likely to be of any great help to her.  she understands that the diagnoses made from open lung biopsy are not all that specific and that the treatment for the few specific things that can be detected are not often well tolerated or extremely helpful. we are going to see her back in a month to see how her breathing is doing.  we will cancel her open lung biopsy for tomorrow and decide whether she should follow up with a pulmonologist at that time.  i told her i would try to talk to her sister sometime in the next day or two.     <!-- 	pulmo
~~~ -->     clinical history:  a 48-year-old smoker found to have a right upper lobe mass on chest x-ray and is being evaluated for chest pain.  pet scan demonstrated a mass in the right upper lobe and also a mass in the right lower lobe, which were also identified by ct scan.  the lower lobe mass was approximately 1 cm in diameter and the upper lobe mass was 4 cm to 5 cm in diameter.  the patient was referred for surgical treatment. specimen:a.  lung, wedge biopsy right lower lobeb.  lung, resection right upper lobec.  lymph node, biopsy level 2 and 4d.  lymph node, biopsy level 7 subcarinal final diagnosis:a.  wedge biopsy of right lower lobe showing:  adenocarcinoma, grade 2, measuring 1 cm in diameter with invasion of the overlying pleura and with free resection margin.b.  right upper lobe lung resection showing:  adenocarcinoma, grade 2, measuring 4 cm in diameter with invasion of the overlying pleura and with free bronchial margin.  two (2) hilar lymph nodes with no metastatic tumor.c.  lymph node biopsy at level 2 and 4 showing seven (7) lymph nodes with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor.d.  lymph node biopsy, level 7 subcarinal showing (5) lymph nodes with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor. comment:  the morphology of the tumor seen in both lobes is similar and we feel that the smaller tumor involving the right lower lobe is most likely secondary to transbronchial spread from the main tumor involving the right upper lobe.  this suggestion is supported by the fact that no obvious vascular or lymphatic invasion is demonstrated and adjacent to the smaller tumor, there is isolated nests of tumor cells within the air spaces.  furthermore, immunoperoxidase stain for ck-7, ck-20 and ttf are performed on both the right lower and right upper lobe nodule.  the immunohistochemical results confirm the lung origin of both tumors and we feel that the tumor involving the right lower lobe is due to transbronchial spread from the larger tumor nodule involving the right upper lobe.     <!-- 	pulmo

~~~ -->     reason for consult:  i was asked to see this patient with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, on hospice with inferior st-elevation mi. history of present illness:  the patient from prior strokes has expressive aphasia, is not able to express herself in a clear meaningful fashion.  her daughter who accompanies her is very attentive whom i had met previously during drainage of a malignant hemorrhagic pericardial effusion last month.  the patient has been feeling well for the last several weeks, per the daughter, but today per the personal aide, became agitated and uncomfortable at about 2:30 p.m.  at about 7 p.m., the patient began vomiting, was noted to be short of breath by her daughter with garbled speech, arms flopping, and irregular head movements.  her daughter called 911 and her symptoms seemed to improve.  then, she began vomiting.  when the patient&#8217;s daughter asked her if she had chest pain, the patient said yes. she came to the emergency room, an ekg showed inferior st-elevation mi.  i was called immediately and knowing her history, especially, her hospice status with recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, i felt thrombolytic was contraindicated and she would not be a candidate for aggressive interventional therapy with pci/cabg.  she was begun after discussion with the oncologist, on heparin drip and has received morphine, nitro, and beta-blocker, and currently states that she is pain free.  repeat ekg shows normalization of her st elevation in the inferior leads as well as normalization of prior reciprocal changes. past medical history:  significant for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.  in early-to-mid december, she had an admission and was found to have a malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade requiring urgent drainage.  we did repeat an echo several weeks later and that did not show any recurrence of the pericardial effusion.  she is on hospice from the medical history, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, history of multiple cva. medications:  medications as an outpatient:1.  amiodarone 200 mg once a day.2.  roxanol concentrate 5 mg three hours p.r.n. pain. allergies:  codeine.  no shrimp, seafood, or dye allergy. family history:  negative for cardiac disease. social history:  she does not smoke cigarettes.  she uses alcohol.  no use of illicit drugs.  she is divorced and lives with her daughter.  she is a retired medical librarian from florida. review of systems:  unable to be obtained due to the patient&#8217;s aphasia. physical examination:  height 5 feet 3, weight of 106 pounds, temperature 97.1 degrees, blood pressure ranges from 138/82 to 111/87, pulse 61, respiratory rate 22.  o2 saturation 100%.  on general exam, she is an elderly woman with now marked aphasia, which per her daughter waxes and wanes, was more pronounced and she nods her head up and down when she says the word, no, and conversely, she nods her head side-to-side when she uses the word yes with some discordance in her head gestures with vocalization.  heent shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  she has dry mucosal membrane.  she now has a right facial droop, which per her daughter is new.  neck veins are not distended.  no carotid bruits visible.  skin:  warm, well perfused.  lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  no wheezes.  cardiac exam:  s1, s2, regular rate.  no significant murmurs.  pmi is nondisplaced.  abdomen:  soft, nondistended.  extremities:  without edema, on limited exam.  neurological exam seems to show only the right facial droop. diagnostic/laboratory data:  ekgs as reviewed above.  her last ecg shows normalization of prior st elevation in the inferior leads with q waves and first-degree av block, pr interval 280 milliseconds.  further lab shows sodium 135, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, bun 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 162, troponin 0.17, inr 1.27, white blood cell count 1.3, hematocrit 31, platelet count of 179. chest x-ray, no significant pericardial effusion. impression:  the patient is a 69-year-old woman with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, now admitted with cerebrovascular accident and transient inferior myocardial infarction, which appears to be canalized.  i will discuss this in detail with the patient and her daughter, and clearly, her situation is quite guarded with likely poor prognosis, which they are understanding of. recommendations:1.  i think it is reasonable to continue heparin, but clearly she would be at risk for hemorrhagic pericardial effusion recurrence.2.  morphine is appropriate, especially for preload reduction and other comfort measures as appropriate.3.  would avoid other blood thinners including plavix, integrilin, and certainly, she is not a candidate for a thrombolytic with which the patient and her daughter are in agreement with after a long discussion. other management

~~~ -->     reason for consultation:  loculated left effusion, multilobar pneumonia.    chief complaint/history of present illness:  the patient is a 67-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital on 12/22/09 when she had a diagnosis of multilobar pneumonia along with arrhythmia and heart failure as well as renal insufficiency.  post admission various measures were instituted to address her different manifestations including cardizem drip.  she had rehydration performed and also was given some diuretics.  ultimately there was improvement in her febrile status and renal status.  however most recently she had elevated white count and a repeat cat scan was performed.  this showed fluid collection in the left chest but also in the right chest.  the left fluid collection was also felt to be loculated. at the same time she was appearing to be quite ill with elevated white count, elevated temperature and for these reasons cardiothoracic consultation was obtained for addressing this fluid collection in the left chest.  past medical history:  significant for asthma, hypertension and history of pneumonias.  medications:  at home she was on symbicort, ibuprofen, prednisone and biaxin.  currently she is also on zyprexa, alcohol withdrawal medications, zosyn 3.375 grams every eight hours, lasix 20 mg daily, cardizem cd 120 mg daily, nexium 40 mg p.o. daily, solu-cortef 50 mg q.24h., lovenox 40 mg subcu daily, novolog sliding scale insulin.  social history:  alcohol drinking history, quit smoking about 30 years ago.  the patient is married.  allergies:  no known drug allergies.  review of systems:  no remarkable surgical history present.  the patient at this time appears confused and the chart review as well as talking to the son revealed most of the history.  apart from recent fevers and confusion the system review is negative.    examination:  on examination she is lying supine in bed, appears comfortable, awake, alert but is not oriented and is quite confused.  blood pressure is 110/70, heart rate is 80 per minute regular rhythm, saturations are 98 and 99% on four liters nasal cannula.  heent pupils equal, extraocular movements intact.  sclerae anicteric.  conjunctivae are pink and moist.  neck is supple.  trachea is midline.  thyroid is not enlarged. i  did not appreciate any neck masses or neck bruits.  bilateral crackles and rales in the mid lung fields more prominent on the left side and markedly diminished breath sounds especially in the left base.  s1, s2 regular rate and rhythm. no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  abdomen is soft, no organomegaly, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds.  extremities do not reveal cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  there is 1+ peripheral edema.    laboratory data:  review of lab data white count 13.4, hemoglobin 8.6 and hematocrit 25, platelet count 317.  bun and creatinine 10 and 0.9.  review of ct scan data infiltrate consolidation in multiple lobes of the lung both on the left side as well as at the right base.  right pleural effusion small layering at the base.  left pleural effusion appears to have loculations within the fissure as well as along the chest wall.  impression and plan:  the patient is a 67-year-old female who is recovering from multilobar pneumonia and is on antibiotics.  it appears she has had progression of her disease process in her left chest with now forming loculations.  we have been asked to consult for management of this pleural effusion.  after discussion with the patient&#8217;s son who would like to proceed in a step-wise fashion from least invasive to most invasive techniques, i counseled him that we should start with chest tube placement and this should be followed with activase instillation to try to break up the loculations, pending on the findings on the chest tube placement.  if necessary video assisted thoracoscopic procedure or open decortication can be performed.      <!-- 	pulmo
~~~ -->     reason for consultation:  new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer. history of present illness:  abcd is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history who has now been diagnosed with a new non-small cell lung cancer stage iv metastatic disease.  we are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options. abcd and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain.  initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened.  eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room.  a ct scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease.  at that point, he was transferred to xyz hospital for further evaluation.  on admission on 12/19/08, a ct scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes.  the ct scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum.  this was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the svc and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery.  there was an abnormal lymph node noted in the ap window and left hilar region.  there was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm.  there was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease.  there were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base.  there was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing.  there was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax.  in the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor.  all other structures appeared normal.  on 12/22/08, a ct-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed.  pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  at this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options. on further review, abcd states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite.  he has not ever had a chronic smoker&#8217;s cough and still does not have a cough.  he has no sputum production or hemoptysis.  he and his wife are very anxious about this diagnosis. past medical history:  he denies any history of heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, liver disease, hepatitis major infection, seizure disorders or other problems. past surgical history:  he denies having any surgeries. allergies:  no known drug allergies. medications:  at home he takes no medication except occasional aspirin or ibuprofen, recently for his flank pain.  he does take a multivitamin on occasion. social history:  he has about a 30-pack-a-year history of smoking.  he used to drink alcohol heavily and has a history of getting a dui about a year-and-half ago resulting in him having his truck-driving license revoked.  since that time he has worked with printing press.  he is married and has two children, both of whom are grown in their 20s, but are now living at home. family history:  his mother died for alcohol-related complications.  he otherwise denies any history of cancers, bleeding disorders, clotting disorders, or other problems. review of systems:  general/constitutional:  he has lost about 20 pounds of weight as described above.  he also has a trouble with fatigue.  no lightheadedness or dizziness.  heent:  he denies any new or changing headache, change in vision, double vision, or loss of vision, ringing in his ears, loss of hearing in one year.  he does not take care of his teeth very well but currently he has no mouth, jaw, or teeth pain.  respiratory:  he has had some little bit of dyspnea on exertion but otherwise denies shortness of breath at rest.

odynophagia, dysphagia, heartburn on a regular basis, abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, diarrhea, blood in his stool, or black tarry stools.  he has been somewhat constipated recently.  gu:  he denies any burning with urination, kidney stones, blood in his urine, dysuria, difficulty getting his urine out or other problems.  musculoskeletal:  he denies any new bony aches or pains including back pain, hip pain, and rib pain.  no muscle aches, no joint swelling, and no history of gout.  skin:  no rashes, no bruising, petechia, non-healing wounds, or ulcerations.  he has had no nail or hair changes.  hem:  he denies any bloody nose, bleeding gums, easy bruising, easy bleeding, swollen lymphs or bumps.  endocrine:  he denies any tremor, shakiness, history of diabetes, thyroid

sounds.extremities:  no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  no joint swelling.  full range of motion.skin:  no rashes, wounds, ulcerations, bruises, or petechia.neurologic:  cranial nerves ii through xii are intact.  he has intact sensation to light touch throughout.  he has 2+ deep tendon reflexes bilaterally in the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar and ankle reflexes.  he is alert and oriented x3. laboratory data:  his white blood cell count is 9.4, hemoglobin 13.0, hematocrit 38%, and platelets 365,000.  the differential shows 73% neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 7.6% monocytes, 1.9% eosinophils, and 0.7% basophils.  chemistry shows sodium 138, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, co2 of 31, bun 9, creatinine 1.0, glucose 104, calcium 12.3, alkaline phosphatase 104, ast 16, alt 12, total protein 7.6, albumin 3.5, total bilirubin 0.5, ionized calcium 1.7.  his inr is 1.0 with the pt of 11.4 and a ptt of 31.3. imagining data:  mri of the brain on 12/23/08 &#8211; this shows some mild white matter disease, question of minimal pontine ischemic gliosis as well as a small incidental venous angioma in the left posterior frontal deep white matter.  there is no evidence of cerebral metastasis, hemorrhage, or acute infarction. assessment/plan:  abcd is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history, who now presents with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  at this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable.  his wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis.  they preferred not to know the exact average as to how long someone lives with this disease.  i did offer chemotherapy as a way to treat this disease.  chemotherapy has been associated both with palliation of symptoms as well as prolong survival.  at this point, he has an excellent functional status and i think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite well. in terms of chemotherapy, i talked briefly about the side affects including but not limited to gi upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood counts including the possible need for transfusion as well as the risk of infections, which in some rare cases can be fatal.  i would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine.  this would be both medications given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8.  this cycle will be repeated after 1-week break so that the cycle lasts 21 days.  the goal will be to complete 6 cycles of this as long as he is responding and tolerating the medication. in terms of staging mr. abcd&#8217;s had all the appropriate staging.  a pet-ct scan could be done, but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the ct scans that we have. at this point, his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain.  he will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control.  as this is the holiday weekend, i do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them, but i did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on monday.  at that point, we will get him in and i will also begin working on making arrangements for his chemotherapy. thank you very much for this interesting consult.     <!-- 	pulmo

an estimated creatinine clearance of 23 ml/minute.  i unsure whether this renal failure is recent or she has had slow progression of her renal failure.  i would appreciate it if you could forward the results of any laboratory tests done in the last two to three years to determine her creatinine.  i am unsure of the exact etiology of her renal failure.  i ordered a renal ultrasound to evaluate the kidney size and also to evaluate if she has been emptying her bladder completely.  the patient does report that she has dribbling of urine and some incontinence.  also, i ordered a comprehensive metabolic panel, cbc, intact pth, hepatitis b and c panel, and a 24-hour urine for protein and creatinine clearance.  the patient has had recurrent utis in the past and it is possible that she has had chronic pyelonephritis and scarring resulting in chronic renal failure.  she has a urinary tract infection currently with multiple wbcs on the microscopy.  i prescribed ciprofloxacin 250 mg q.d. for 10 days and we will send her urine out for cultures, and we adjust her antibiotics if her urine cultures shows resistant organisms.  i explained to the patient that if her renal function continues to worsen we might need to discuss renal replacement therapy with regards to either transplantation or dialysis.  we will address this issue after the results are available.  i also ordered a postvoid residual to see if she is emptying her bladder completely.  i have advised her not to use any nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.  2.    hypertension.  blood pressure is controlled off medications.  we will reevaluate the blood pressure            on the next visit.  3.    urinary tract infection.  prescribed cipro 250 mg q.d. pending cultures.4.    chronic diarrhea.  the patient states she has

~~~ -->     history of present illness:  the patient is a 50-year-old african american female with past medical history significant for hypertension and endstage renal disease, on hemodialysis secondary to endstage renal disease, last hemodialysis was on june 22, 2007.  the patient presents with no complaints for cadaveric renal transplant.  after appropriate cross match and workup of hla typing of both recipient and cadaveric kidneys, the patient was deemed appropriate for operative intervention and transplantation of kidney. preoperative diagnosis:  endstage renal disease. postoperative diagnosis:  endstage renal disease. procedure:  cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis. estimated blood loss:  400 ml. fluids:  one liter of normal saline and one liter of 5% of albumin. anesthesia:  general endotracheal. specimen:  none. drain:  none. complications:  none. the patient tolerated the procedure without any complication. procedure in detail:  the patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  after adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the asis down to the suprapubic space.  after this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat.  camper&#8217;s and scarpa&#8217;s were dissected with electrocautery.  hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery.  the external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery.  then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia.  additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion.  after these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection.  after the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery.  upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties.  after the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane.  this was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly.  the round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well.  the dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery.  this alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery.  after the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture.  the right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  after the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well.  an additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein.  this was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured.  hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control.  the dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area.  careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection.  at this time, satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein.  this was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length.  the heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked.  the renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area.  a 5-0 double-ended prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 prolene, these were tied down and secured.  the renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles.  the dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 prolene securing both superior and inferior poles.  after such time the 5-0 prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  after this was done and the artery was secured, the satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over.  the flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow.  the bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney.  the kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow.  at this time, all satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed.  the dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified.  appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry.  this was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion.  before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length.  at this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well.  subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder.  this was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation.  additional vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself.  at this time, an ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again.  this was inspected and noted for proper control.  irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects.  at this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time.  the kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved.  a 1-0 prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior.  this was secured and knots were dumped.  subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running monocryl.  the patient tolerated

~~~ -->     history of present illness:  this is a 48-year-old black male with stage iv chronic kidney disease, likely secondary to hiv nephropathy who presents to clinic for followup having missed prior clinic appointments.  he was last seen in this clinic on 05/29/2007 by dr. x.  this is the first time that i have met the patient.  the patient&#8217;s history of renal insufficiency dates back to 06/2006 when he was hospitalized for an hiv-associated complication.  he is unclear of the exact reason for his hospitalization at that time, but he was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and was followed in our renal clinic for approximately one year.  he had a baseline creatinine during that time of between 3.2 to 3.3.  when he was initially diagnosed with renal insufficiency, he had been noncompliant with his haart regimen.  since that time, he has been very compliant with treatment for his hiv and is seeing dr. y in our infectious disease clinic.  he is currently on three-drug antiretroviral therapy.  his last cd4 count in 03/2008 was 350.  he has had no hiv complications since he was last seen in our clinic.  the patient is also followed by dr. z at the outpatient va clinic, here in abcd, although he has not seen her in approximately one year.  the patient has an av fistula that was placed in late 2006.  the latest blood work that i have is from 06/11/2008 and shows a serum creatinine of 3.8, which represents a gfr of 22 and a potassium of 5.9.  these laboratories were drawn by his infectious disease doctor and the results prompted their recommendation for him to return to our clinic for further evaluation.  the only complaint that the patient has at this time is some difficulty sleeping.  he was given ambien by his primary care doctor, but this has not helped significantly with his difficulty sleeping.  he says that he has trouble getting to sleep.  the ambien will allow him to sleep for about two hours, and then he is awake again.  he is tired during the day, but is not taking any daytime naps.  he has no history of excessive snoring or apneic periods.  he has no history of falling asleep at work or while driving.  he has never had a formal sleep study.  he does continue to work in sales at a local butcher shop. review of systems:  he denies any change in his appetite.  he has actually gained some weight in recent months.  he denies any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort.  he denies any pruritus.  he denies any lower extremity edema.  all other systems are reviewed and negative. past medical history:1.  stage iv chronic kidney

abcd.  he is employed at the sales counter of a local butcher shop.  he continues to smoke one pack of cigarettes daily, as he has for the past 28 years.  he denies any alcohol or illicit substances. family history:  his mother is deceased.  he said that she had some type of paralysis before she died.  his father is deceased at age 64 of a head and neck cancer.  he has a 56-year-old brother with type-two diabetes and blindness secondary to diabetic retinopathy.  he has a 41-year-old brother who has hypertension.  he has a sister who has thyroid disease. physical examination:vital signs:  weight is 191 pounds.  his temperature is 97.1.  pulse is 94.  blood pressure by automatic cuff 173/97, by manual cuff 180/90.heent:  his oropharynx is clear without thrush or ulceration.neck:  supple

his ferritin is 258, iron is 55, and percent sat is 24. impression:  this is a 48-year-old black male with stage iv chronic kidney disease likely secondary to hiv nephropathy, although there is no history of renal biopsy, who has been noncompliant with the renal clinic and presents today for followup at the recommendation of his infection disease doctors. recommendations:1.  renal.  his serum creatinine is progressively worsening.  his creatinine was 3.2 the last time we saw him in 05/2007 and today is 4.3.  this represents a gfr of 19.  this is stage iv chronic kidney disease.  he does have vascular access and this appears to be ready to use.  he is having some difficulty sleeping and it is possible that this represents some early signs of uremia.  otherwise, he has no signs or symptoms of uremia at this time.  i am going to touch base with the dialysis educator and try to get the patient in to the dialysis teaching classes.  he has already received some literature for the dialysis teaching, but has not yet enrolled in the classes.  i have encouraged him to continue to exercise his right forearm.  i am also going to contact the transplant coordinator and see if he can be evaluated for possible transplant.  given his progression of his chronic kidney disease, i will anticipate that he will need to start dialysis soon.2.  hypertension.  i have added labetolol 100 mg b.i.d. to his antihypertensive regimen.  he shows no signs at this point of volume overload, although if he does demonstrate this in the future, his lasix could be increased.  goal blood pressure would be less than 130/80.3.  hyperkalemia.  i am going to instruct him in a low-potassium diet and decrease his valsartan to 20 mg daily.  i will have him return in one week to recheck his potassium.  if his potassium continues to remain elevated, he may require initiation of dialysis for this.4.  bone metabolism.  his pth is elevated and i am going to add phoslo 800 mg t.i.d. with meals.  his corrected calcium is 9.7, and i would like to avoid calcium-containing phosphate bonders in this situation.5.  acid base.  his bicarbonate is 18 and i will initiate the sodium bicarbonate 650 mg three tablets t.i.d.6.  anemia.  his hemoglobin is at goal for this stage of chronic kidney disease.  his iron stores are adequate.7.  nutrition.  his albumin is 3.2 and this is fairly close to his baseline over the past several months.8.  hiv.  his most recent cd4 count is 350.  he has been very compliant, it seems, with his antiretroviral therapy.  he has followup with dr. y.9.  transplant candidacy.  i have informed the patient that he may indeed be a candidate for transplant, although he is likely to need dialysis before he could be transplanted.  i have instructed him to try to stop smoking.  this is for making him a better candidate.  i have also encouraged him to continue to be compliant with his antiretroviral therapies as this would be a requirement for transplant. disposition:  the patient is to return to clinic in one month&#8217;s time.     <!-- 	renal

~~~ -->     admission diagnoses:1.  syncope.2.  end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis.3.  congestive heart failure.4.  hypertension. discharge diagnoses:1.  syncope.2.  end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis.3.  congestive heart failure.4.  hypertension. condition on discharge:  stable. procedure performed:  none. hospital course:  the patient is a 44-year-old african-american male who was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis three times per week approximately four to five months ago.  he reports that over the past month, he has been feeling lightheaded when standing and has had three syncopal episodes during this time with return of consciousness after several minutes.  he reportedly had this even while seated and denied overt dizziness.  he reports this lightheadedness is made even worse when standing.  he has had these symptoms almost daily over the past month.  he does report some confusion when he awakens.  he reports that he loses consciousness for two to three minutes.  denies any bowel or bladder loss, although he reports very little urine output secondary to his end-stage renal disease.  he denied any palpitations, warmth, or diaphoresis, which is indicative of vasovagal syncope.  there were no witnesses to his syncopal episodes.  he also denied any clonic activity and no history of seizures.  in the emergency room, the patient was given fluids and orthostatics were checked.  at that time, orthostatics were negative; however, due to the fact that fluid had been given before, it is impossible to rule out orthostatic hypotension.  the patient presented to the hospital on coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d. and lisinopril 10 mg daily secondary to his hypertension, congestive heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy and end-stage renal disease.  regarding his syncopal episodes, he was admitted with likely orthostatic hypotension.  cardiology was consulted and their recommendations were to reduce the lisinopril to 5 mg daily.  at that time, the coreg had been held secondary to hypotension.  cardiology also ordered a nuclear medicine myocardial perfusion stress test.  regarding the end-stage renal disease, nephrology was consulted as the patient was due for hemodialysis treatment the day following admission.  nephrology was able to perform dialysis on the patient and renal concurred that the presyncopal symptoms were likely due to decreased intravascular volume in the postdialytic time frame.  renal agreed with decreasing his lisinopril to 5 mg daily and decreasing the coreg to 6.25 mg b.i.d.  they reported that the procrit should be continued.  as previously indicated regarding the dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiology ordered a nuclear medicine stress test to be performed.  also, regarding the patient&#8217;s hypertension, he actually was noted to have hypotension on admission, and as previously stated, the coreg was originally discontinued and then it was restarted at 6.25 mg b.i.d. and the patient tolerated this well.  the patient&#8217;s hospital course remained uncomplicated until september 17, 2007, the day the nuclear medicine stress test was scheduled.  the patient stated that he was reluctant to proceed with the test and he was afraid of needles and the risks associated with the test although the procedure was explained to the patient and the risks of the procedure were quit low, the patient proceeded to discharge himself against medical advice. discharge instructions/medications:the patient left ama.  no specific discharge instructions and medications were given.  at the time of the patient leaving ama, his medications were as follows:1.  aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.2.  multivitamin, nephrocaps one cap p.o. daily.3.  fosrenol 500 mg chewable t.i.d.4.  lisinopril 2.5 mg daily.6.  coreg 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d.7.  procrit 10,000 units inject every tuesday, thursday, and saturday.8.  heparin 5000 units q.8h. subcutaneous for dvt prophylaxis.     <!-- 	renal
~~~ -->     reason for consultation: acute renal failure. history:  limited data is available; i have reviewed his admission notes. apparently this man was found down by a family member, was taken to medical center, and subsequently flown here. he has got respiratory failure, multi-organ system failure syndrome, and has renal insufficiency, as well. markers of renal function have been fairly stable. i do not presently see indicators that he historically has been oliguric. the bun and creatinine have been fairly stable. it is not clear whether he was taking his lisinopril up until the time of his demise, and it is also not clear whether he was taking his diuretic. earlier thoughts had been that he could have had rhabdomyolysis, but the highest cpk i find recorded is 1500, the phosphorus is not elevated, though i acknowledge the serum calcium is low. i see no markers of myoglobinuria nor serum level of myoglobin. he has received iv fluid resuscitation, good broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, continues mechanically ventilated, and is on parenteral nutrition. past medical history: not obtained from the patient, but is reviewed in other physician&#8217;s notes and seems notable for probably atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease wherein he was taking imdur and digoxin, reportedly. a suggestion of hypertensive disease versus bph, he was on terazosin. suggestion of chf versus hypertension versus volume overload, treated with lasix. he was iron, i presume for anemia. he was on potassium, lisinopril and aspirin. allergies: other physician&#8217;s notes indicate no known allergies. family history: not available. social history: not available. review of systems: not available. physical examination:general: an older white male who is intubated, edematous, and appears uncomfortable.heent: male pattern baldness. pupils equally round, no icterus. intubated. og tube in place.neck: not tested for suppleness, no carotid bruits are heard. neck vein distention is not seen.lungs: he has diffuse expiratory wheezing anteriorly, laterally and posteriorly. i would describe the wheezes as coarse. i hear no present rales. breath sounds otherwise are symmetrical.heart: heart tones regular to auscultation, currently without audible rub or gallop sounds.breasts: not enlarged.abdomen: on plane. bowel sounds presently are normal. abdomen, i believe, is soft on plane, normal bowel sounds, no bruits, no liver edge felt, no hjr, no spleen tip, no suprapubic fullness.gu: catheter draining a dark yellow urine.extremities: very edematous. pulses not palpable. cyanosis not observed. fungal changes are not observed.neurological: not otherwise assessed. laboratory data: reviewed. impression:1. acute renal failure, suspected. likely due to multi-organ system failure syndrome, with antecedent lisinopril use at home and at time of demise. he also reportedly was on lasix prior to hospitalization, ? hypovolemia as a consequence.2. multi-organ system failure/systemic inflammatory response syndrome, with septic shock.3. i am under-whelmed presently with the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, if the maximum ck recorded is 1500.4. antecedent hypoxemia, with renal hypoperfusion.5. diffuse aspiration pneumonitis suggested. discussion/plan: i think the renal function will follow the patient. supportive care, attention to stability of a euvolemic state, will be important at this time. he is currently nonoliguric, has apparently stable, diffuse, bilateral wheezing, with adequate gas exchange. he is on tpn, antimicrobials, and has been on vasopressive agents. blood pressures are close to acceptable, he may now be wearing off his lisinopril, assuming he was taking it prior to admission. i would use diuretics to maintain central euvolemia. recorded i&#8217;s are substantially o&#8217;s during the course of the hospitalization, i presume as part of his resuscitation effort. no central pressures or monitoring of same is currently available. i will follow with you. no present indication for hemodialysis. antimicrobials are being handled by others.     <!-- 	renal
~~~ -->     reason for consultation:  renal failure evaluation for possible dialysis therapy. history of present illness:  this is a 47-year-old gentleman, who works offshore as a cook, who about 4 days ago noted that he was having some swelling in his ankles and it progressively got worse over the past 3 to 4 days, until he was swelling all the way up to his mid thigh bilaterally.  he also felt like he could not make much urine, and his wife, who is a nurse instructed him to force fluids.  while he was there, he was drinking cranberry juice, some powerade, but he also has a history of weightlifting and had been taking on a creatine protein drink on a daily basis for some time now.  he presented here with very decreased urine output until a foley catheter was placed and about 500 ml was noted in his bladder.  he did have a cpk level of about 234 while his bun and creatinine on admission were 109 and 6.9.  despite iv hydration fluids, his potassium has gone up from 5.4 to 6.1.  he did not put out any significant urine and his weight was documented at 103 kg.  he was given a dose of kayexalate.  his potassium came down to like about 5.9 and urine studies were ordered.  his urinalysis did show that he had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria and his protein-creatinine ratio was about 9 gm of protein consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria.  he did have a low albumin of 1.9.  he denied any nonsteroidal usage, any recreational drug abuse, and his urine drug screen was unremarkable, and he denied any history of hypertension or any other medical problems.  he has not had any blood work except for drug screens that are required by work and no work up by any primary care physician because he has not seen one for primary care.  he is very concerned because his mother and father were both on dialysis, which he thinks were due to diabetes and both parents have expired.  he denied any hemoptysis, gross hematuria, melena, hematochezia, hemoptysis, hematemesis, no seizures, no palpitations, no pruritus, no chest pain.  he did have a decrease in his appetite, which all started about thursday.  we were asked to see this patient in consultation by dr. x because of his renal failure and the need for possible dialysis therapy.  he was significantly hypertensive on admission with a blood pressure of 162/80. past medical history:  unremarkable. past surgical history:  unremarkable. family history:  both mother and father were on dialysis of end-stage renal disease. social history:  he is married.  he does smoke despite understanding the risks associated with smoking a pack every 6 days.  does not drink alcohol or use any recreational drug use.  he was on no prescribed medications.  he did have a fairly normal psa of about 119 and i had ordered a renal ultrasound which showed fairly normal-sized kidneys and no evidence of hydronephrosis or mass, but it was consistent with increased echogenicity in the cortex, findings representative of medical renal disease. physical examination:vital signs:  blood pressure is 153/77, pulse 66, respiration 18, temperature 98.5.general:  he was alert and oriented x 3, in no apparent distress, well-developed male.heent:  normocephalic, atraumatic.  pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  extraocular muscles intact.neck:  supple.  no jvd, adenopathy, or bruit.chest:  clear to auscultation.heart:  regular rate and rhythm without a rub.abdomen:  soft, nontender, nondistended.  positive bowel sounds.extremities:  showed no clubbing, cyanosis.  he did have 2+ pretibial edema in both lower extremities.neurologic:  no gross focal findings.skin:  showed no active skin lesions. laboratory data:  sodium 138, potassium 6.1, chloride 108, co2 22, glucose 116, bun 111, creatinine 7.29, estimated gfr 10 ml/minute.  calcium 7.4 with an albumin of 1.9.  mag normal at 2.2.  urine culture negative at 12 hours.  his random urine sodium was low at 12.  random urine protein was 4756, and creatinine in the urine was 538.  urine drug screen was unremarkable.  troponin was within normal limits.  phosphorus slightly elevated at 5.7.  cpk level was 234, white blood cells 6.5, hemoglobin 12.2, platelet count 188,000 with 75% segs.  pt 10.0, inr 1.0, ptt at 27.3.  b-natriuretic peptide 718.  urinalysis showed 3+ protein, 4+ blood, negative nitrites, and trace leukocytes, 5 to 10 wbc&#8217;s, greater than 100 rbc&#8217;s, occasional fine granular casts, and moderate transitional cells. impression:1.  acute kidney injury of which etiology is unknown at this time, with progressive azotemia unresponsive to iv fluids.2.  hyperkalemia due to renal failure, slowly improving with kayexalate.3.  microscopic hematuria with nephrotic range proteinuria, more consistent with a glomerulonephropathy nephritis.4.  hypertension. plan:  i will give him kayexalate 15 gm p.o. q.6h. x 2 more doses since he is responding and his potassium is already down to 5.2.  i will also recheck a urinalysis, consult the surgeon in the morning for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement, and consult case managers to start work on a transfer to abcd center per the patient and his wife&#8217;s request, which will occur after his second dialysis treatment if he remains stable.  we will get a bmp, phosphorus, mag, cbc in the morning since he was given 80 mg of lasix for fluid retention.  we will also give him 10 mg of zaroxolyn p.o.  discontinue all iv fluids.  check an anca hepatitis profile, c3 and c4 complement levels along with ch 50 level.  i did discuss with the patient and his wife the need for kidney biopsy and they would like the kidney biopsy to be performed closer to home at ochsner where his family is, since he only showed up here because of the nearest hospital located to his offshore job.  i do agree with getting him transferred once he is stable from his hyperkalemia and he starts his dialysis. i appreciate consult.  i did discuss with him the importance of the kidney biopsies to direct treatment, finding the underlying etiology of his acute renal failure and to also give him prognostic factors of renal recovery.     <!-- 	renal
